# CHCS Finance Policy

## Budgeting Policy

### Budget Process and Implementation
The Governing Board of The Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall approve an annual operating budget for each fiscal year that will project income and expenses and will provide for programs and support services.  The board will approve the annual budget prior to the start of the school year.
The board authorizes the Principal to manage CHCS in accordance with the approved annual operating budget.  Programmatic or operational changes that may have a significant impact on the annual budget shall be reviewed by the board between budget cycles and may lead to a budget revision.

### Financial Planning

Budgeting for any fiscal period shall not deviate materially from the mission, goals, and strategies; risk fiscal jeopardy; nor fail to show a generally acceptable level of foresight.  Accordingly, the Principal shall develop a budget that:
* Contains enough detail to enable accurate projection of revenues and expenses, separation of capital and operational items, cash flow and subsequent audit trails, and disclosure of planning assumptions
* Plans the expenditure in any fiscal year of no more funds than are available or conservatively projected to be received in that period
* Maintains current assets (cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, etc.) at any time to no less than 100 percent of current liabilities (accounts payable, debt due in 12 months, etc.)
* Does not deviate materially from board-stated priorities and board-approved budgets (except for grant revenues received during a fiscal year and their related expenditures) without seeking board approval

### Budget Objectives
The budget process is designed to provide:
•	A means by which spending limits are set based on expected revenue levels
•	A means for setting program priorities and allocating resources to those priorities
•	A means for comparison of actual financial results to budgeted amounts and analysis of differences from those budgeted amounts

### Preparation of Budget

Prior to the end of the school year, the Principal and the Finance Committee shall review the financial activity for the prior fiscal year, including actual results of operations, mission of the organization, goals, short-term plans, and any other relevant information deemed appropriate.

### Approval of Budget

After preparation of the budget for the next school/fiscal year, copies of the budget and any material proposals to reduce or increase costs shall be sent to all board members.  No later than the regularly scheduled June board meeting, or the board meeting closest to the end of the fiscal year, the board shall meet to discuss and approve or reject the budget.  If the budget is rejected, the board shall direct the Principal and Board Treasurer to amend the budget for changes as directed by the board.

### Review of Budget

Once the budget has been set for the school/fiscal year, the budget shall be included in the school accounting system.  As monthly financial statements are prepared, a comparison of actual monthly and year to date results of operations to budget figures shall also be prepared.  The financial statements and budget variances (with detailed explanations for material variances) shall be reviewed by the Finance Committee and distributed to the board.  When deemed necessary, the board shall revise the budget to fund additional services or make allowances for other unbudgeted revenues or expenses.

### Adjustments to the Budget

During the course of the school year, the school may be faced with unbudgeted or unexpected costs, or may need to reallocate funding between program areas.  The Principal and the Finance Committee shall prepare a request for allocation from the board that either allocates funds from annual surplus or reserves, or shifts funding between programming areas.  This request shall be presented to the board for approval or rejection.  If the request is rejected, the board shall direct the Principal and Board Treasurer to amend the request for changes as directed by the board.  At no time may these adjustments allocate restricted funds towards costs that violate the terms of their grant.
 
## Procurement Policy

### Budget
Anticipated expenditures shall be included in the normal budgetary process, and when necessary, as part of the budget.  The annual budget shall include purchase requests for all new and replacement capital assets.

### Purchasing
Any equipment or services with an estimated value of $2000 or more shall be purchased through competitive bidding or comparative pricing by at least three vendors whenever possible.  Comparative pricing or competitive bidding should also be used periodically for regularly purchased materials, supplies, services, and insurance.

### Purchasing Process
Competitive bids should be solicited through a simple RFP process. 
Prior to issuing any RFP, that RFP should be authorized by the Finance committee and reconciled with the school budget. A rough estimate of the intended cost should be documented and agreed upon and calculated by the treasurer and principal prior to issuance of an RFP.
That RFP process should include the basic specifications of the item or service to be required, and may be as simple as an email with a bulleted list of one-sentence requirements, sent to a minimum three vendors with a specific deadline. If the estimated contract value exceeds $5,000 annually, the contract should also be posted to the CHCS website.
The principal should use sound judgment in selecting the winner of the bidding process, and should not default to lowest cost. Other factors to include in the selection of a vendor should be:
1.	Local preference: businesses that are located within the Palmetto and Chattahoochee Hills area should be given a preference. Should the bids fall within a 10% range of one another, and no other determining factor is in question, the purchase should go to the local vendor.
2.	Strategic interest of the school: businesses that are deemed to have the potential to provide additional, long-term value to the school’s fun operate should be given a preference.
3.	Vendors with a strong-track record of delivering successful projects for the school shall be given a preference over vendors who have not worked with the school before.
4.	Vendors with no track record of the school shall be given a preference over vendors with a weak track-record of delivering successful projects for the school.
All contracts of greater than $100 are required to have payment terms of no less than Net 30.

### Authority
The Principal shall have the authority to make purchases of goods and services that are part of the approved annual budget without additional approval from the board.  This does not alleviate the Principal from the obligation of following appropriate financial controls.
If establishing a new contract for services, the Principal shall seek approval before executing any contracts:

* If the contract value is $10,000 or less, and there are no conflicts of interest with any board member with any of the vendors who have bid on the project the Finance Committee can provide approval.
* The Governing Board must approve any contracts over $10,000.
* All vendors relating to curriculum: substitute teachers, Early Morning and Afternoon Program curriculum expenses, supplies and materials must have approval by the full board.

### Property
Purchase or sale of any long-term assets must be approved by the board.
A fixed-asset inventory of office equipment, computers, and printers will be maintained by the Principal or designee.

##Financial Reporting Policy

### Financial Audit

### Purpose
The Chattahoochee Hills Charter School is required, under statute, to have an annual audit of its financial statements conducted. The purpose of this policy is to:
* Establish the process by which the school contracts for these audit services for a fixed term
* Ensure that the services provided by the external auditors are relevant to the information and fiduciary needs of the board
* Ensure that the school is receiving value for money in the delivery of audit services
* Ensure the independence of the auditors is maintained at the highest level, both in appearance and fact

### Scope
This policy shall apply to all matters relating to the financial and accounting affairs of the school, and to any services provided by the auditors.

### Policy
The agreement for the provision of audit services is between the Chattahoochee Hills Charter School board and the selected audit firm.  The board will decide on the firm to be selected, with recommendations from the Finance Committee.
* An audit will be conducted annually and will include such matters as are standard as well as addressing other specific issues as requested by the board.
* The selection of an audit firm will be based on the fees quoted, the firm’s experience with schools, nonprofit organizations, and the ability of the firm to address any issues identified by the board.
* The recommendation with respect to the selection of an audit firm will be made by the Finance Committee for approval by the board.
* The appointment of auditors will be confirmed annually by the board.
* The school’s auditors should not normally be engaged to perform any non–audit services unless an extraordinary circumstance exists, i.e., where a specific expertise is required that is not reasonably obtained from another vendor. In addition, the auditors shall not perform any substantial services for any board member or the Principal.
* The Finance Committee shall review all non-audit services to be provided to the school by its independent auditor.  With pre-approval of the Finance Committee, the independent auditor may be engaged to perform non–audit services.  The organization may not engage the independent auditor to perform the following non-audit services:
  *	Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the school
  *	Financial information systems design and implementation
  * Appraisal or valuation services
  * Actuarial services
  * Internal audit outsourcing services
  * Management functions or human resources
  * Broker or dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services
  * Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit
  *	Any other service that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants determines is inconsistent with the auditor’s independence

The Board Treasurer is authorized to pre-approve any audit-related or other non-audit services between Finance Committee meetings.  Such interim pre-approvals shall be reviewed with the full committee at its next meeting for its ratification.

### Monitoring
The Finance Committee will review this policy annually, and report on its review to the board including any recommendations for changes to the policy.

### Procedures
While the Principal of the Chattahoochee Hills Charter School is involved in the selection process and is responsible for the management of the audit, the approval of an audit firm is the responsibility of the board.
*	When deemed prudent, the Principal will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) from selected firms with substantial experience auditing nonprofit organizations for the provision of audit services. The RFP will include requests for information on services related to specific issues that the board wishes to address in the course of the audit.
*	The RFP for provision of audit services will be issued to a minimum of three (3) firms eligible to provide audit services in the State of Georgia.
*	The Principal, in consultation with the Board Treasurer and Finance Committee on behalf of the board, will select the audit firms to be included in the RFP.
*	All proposals to engage the independent auditor to perform non-audit services shall be presented to, and approved by, the Principal and Board Treasurer before the proposal is submitted to the Finance Committee for its approval.
*	Each non-audit service that is reviewed by the Finance Committee shall be reflected in a written engagement letter or writing specifying the services to be performed and the cost of such services.

In the event that the Fulton County School system undergoes a competitive selection process for an independent auditor, the Principal and Board Treasurer can recommend, and the board can approve, the use of an independent auditor sourced by Fulton County instead of undertaking its own auditor selection process.

### Schedule
The Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall prepare its annual audit report and submit it to the Fulton County School System by September 30.  The Finance Committee shall review the report and provide recommendation to the board, based on the auditor’s analysis.  The board shall review the audit and recommendations and shall ratify both items at its regularly scheduled September board meeting, or another suitable meeting such that the audit shall be provided to Fulton County on schedule.

### IRS Form 990 and 990-T
The Principal shall ensure that tax payments and other government-ordered payments or filings are filed in a timely and accurate manner.
The Board Treasurer shall sign and certify that the IRS Form 990 is accurate and complete.

### Bonding

Each officer or designated signatory with authority to withdraw funds shall be bonded.  The cost associated to secure the aforementioned coverage shall be that of the school.  The amount of insurance coverage will be reviewed annually by the Finance Committee.

### Borrowing of Funds

If it should ever become necessary for the school to borrow funds from outside sources to fund operations and expansion because of the irregularity of income from the System and/or State, donations, or due to major expansions or revisions of the school’s programs, such funds are to be borrowed only as required to meet these needs, and borrowing is to be consistent with sound fiscal and management practices.  Borrowings are not intended to make up for inadequate planning or spending above budgeted levels.
Borrowing funds should be done within the following guidelines:
1.	Borrowing should be within appropriate limits approved by the board prior to the time of borrowing.
2.	Amounts should be borrowed at the lowest available interest rates.  Where borrowing from individuals can be done at lower than current commercial rates, this may be done.
3.	Most borrowing will be done at short-term conditions due to the seasonal nature of income.  Long-term borrowing will be done only if rates are favorable and amounts for short-term would be at the same minimum level.

### Loans

No loan may be made to any officer, director, or employee of the school, except in accordance with applicable Georgia law.  Any such loan may be made only pursuant to a written agreement approved by the board and reviewed and approved by legal counsel.

Expenses that serve multiple functions shall be allocated between functions whenever possible.  Restricted funds shall only be budgeted, and distributions made, for expenses and activities allowed by the grantor.  The Principal shall monitor all expenditures to ensure that they do not violate the provisions of any restricted funds.

### Chart of Accounts and Accounting Standards

## Risk Management Policy

The Chattahoochee Hills Charter School is committed to protecting its human, financial, tangible, real estate, and goodwill assets and resources through the practice of effective risk management.  The school’s board and management are dedicated to safeguarding the safety and dignity of its paid and volunteer staff, its students, and anyone who has contact with the organization.  To this end, the board will ensure that the organization has a risk management plan for the organization that is reviewed and updated on an annual basis.

### Asset Protection

The Principal shall adequately protect and maintain from unnecessary risk all school assets. Accordingly, the Principal shall:
* Insure against theft and casualty losses of tangible personal property to at least 80 percent replacement value and against liability losses to board members, staff, or the organization itself at no less than minimally acceptable prudent levels
* Have sufficient employee dishonesty insurance and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for personnel with access to material amounts of funds
* Ensure office and equipment is not subjected to improper wear and tear or insufficient maintenance
* Protect the organization, its board, and staff from exposure leading to claims of liability
* Protect intellectual property, information, and files from loss or significant damage
* Seek bids or demonstrate other prudent methods for any purchases over $2,000 and protect against conflicts of interest
* Receive, process, or disburse funds under financial controls that meet the board-appointed auditor’s (or other grant) standards
* Invest or hold operating funds in secure instruments, such as insured checking accounts, CDs, interest-bearing accounts (except when necessary to facilitate ease in operational transactions or where restricted by the funder)
* Acquire, encumber, or dispose of real property only with board approval, with the price set on any property to be disposed of following either a formal market appraisal or analysis of comparable properties by at least two reputable realtors in that market
* Not endanger the organization’s public image or credibility, particularly in ways that would hinder its accomplishment of mission.

### Insurance

The school will purchase necessary policies to insure the organization against risk. Types of insurance to be purchased should include:
* Insurance against employee theft and dishonesty
* Indemnification
* General liability (personal and property damage and punitive damage)
* Commercial (for physical assets)
* Nonprofit Officers’ and Directors’ Liability (also known as association professional liability)
* Workers’ Compensation
* Fidelity bond to cover all personnel handling cash and other financial instruments
* Additional types of insurance needed to protect the organization must be approved by the board.


## Investments, Reserves, and Endowments Policy
### Investments

It is the policy of the board to treat all assets of the Chattahoochee Hills Charter School, including funds that are legally unrestricted, as if held by the school in a fiduciary capacity for the sake of accomplishing its mission and purposes.  These assets are held in a federally-insured financial institution.  At this time, no further investment activities are undertaken or authorized by the board.

### Reserves and Endowments
#### Operating Reserve
The financial objective of the Chattahoochee Hills Charter School is to establish a financial reserve to provide for 1 month of operating income.  The board needs to authorize any disbursements from this fund.  The funds for the reserve fund will come from the surplus from operations, or the net operating excess for each fiscal year.
#### Cash Flow Management
The school’s designated financial officer will be responsible for managing the school’s cash flow and for communicating anticipated distributions and liquidity requirements in a timely manner to any institutions or investment advisors who are managing investments.
#### Endowment Funds

Endowed funds usually require that the principal of the fund remains intact and the income is paid out.  The investment objective is the preservation of principal, to allow distribution of income for designated uses.  These funds shall be invested in the same manner as board-designated reserves, and paid out according to the terms of the endowment.
The Chattahoochee Hills Charter School may establish an unrestricted endowment fund to support the general purposes of the organization.  The principal is to be invested in a prudent manner in accordance with the investment policy as prescribed from time to time by the board, and the income (defined as total return income) is to be used to support the organization’s general purposes.
The school may allow the creation of named endowments to recognize a donor and his or her wishes.
The board, or its designated committee, shall retain the right to dissolve the school’s endowments and use the principal for general purposes or for the restricted purposes contained in each endowment when, in the board’s discretion, the purposes of the endowment can no longer be met or the organization’s needs may so require.
The endowment fund shall annually distribute an amount equal to 5% of the fund’s average value as calculated in this paragraph.  The distributions shall be made quarterly in an amount equal to 1.25% of the calculated distribution value.  The distribution value is the average of the fair market value of the fund as of the close of each of the preceding 4 calendar quarters.  The fund’s market value shall be based upon all assets in the fund including principal and retained income, adjusted for all gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and determined as of the last business day of the quarter.  The distributions shall be made promptly following the close of each quarter.  To the extent that it may legally do so, the organization shall interpret this policy as satisfying a gift provision that calls for retaining principal and distributing income.
