## REVENUE

### Revenue Recognition Policy

Chattahoochee Hills Charter School receives revenue from several types of transactions. Revenue from each of these types of transactions is recognized in the financial statements of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School in the following manner:

1. Fulton County operations - Income is recognized when the monies are received. When Fulton County determines the School's allocation of funds, usually in March or April, the School records either a receivable or payable for the difference.
2.	Contributions - Recognized as income when received or when evidenced by a written pledge, unless accompanied by restrictions or conditions (see the next section on contribution income)


## CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED

### Definitions

The following definitions shall apply with respect to the policies described in this section:

_Contribution_ - An unconditional transfer of cash or other assets to the Organization, or a settlement or cancellation of the Organization's liabilities, in a voluntary nonreciprocal transfer by another entity acting other than as an owner.

_Condition_ - A donor-imposed stipulation that specifies a future and uncertain event whose occurrence or failure to occur gives the promisor a right of return of the assets it has transferred to the Organization or releases the promisor from its obligation to transfer its assets.

_Restriction_ - A donor-imposed stipulation that specifies a use for the contributed asset that is more specific than broad limits resulting from the nature of the Organization, the environment in which it operates, and the purposes specified in Chattahoochee Hills Charter School’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. Restrictions on Chattahoochee Hills Charter School’s use of an asset may be temporary or permanent.

_Promise to Give_ - A written or oral agreement to contribute cash or other assets to Chattahoochee Hills Charter School

_Exchange Transaction_ - A reciprocal transaction in which Chattahoochee Hills Charter School and another entity each receive and sacrifice something of approximately equal value.

### Accounting for Contributions

Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall recognize contribution income in the period in which the Organization receives restricted or unrestricted assets in nonreciprocal transfers, or unconditional promises of future nonreciprocal asset transfers, from donors. Contribution income shall be classified as increases in unrestricted, temporarily restricted, or permanently restricted net assets based on the existence or absence of such restrictions.

Unconditional promises to give shall be recorded as assets and increases in temporarily restricted net assets (contribution income) of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School in the period that Chattahoochee Hills Charter School receives evidence that a promise to support the Organization has been made. Unconditional promises to give that are to be collected within one year shall be recorded at their face value, less any reserve for uncollectible promises, as estimated by management. Unconditional promises to give that are collectible over time periods in excess of one year shall be recorded at their discounted net present value. Accretion of discount on such promises to give shall be recorded as contribution income in each period leading up to the due date of the promise to give. The interest rate that shall be used in calculating net present values of unconditional promises to give is the risk-free rate of return available to Chattahoochee Hills Charter School at the time the Organization receives a promise from a donor.

When the final time or use restriction associated with a contributed asset has been met, a reclassification between temporarily restricted and unrestricted net assets shall be recorded.

When it receives support in the form of volunteer labor, Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall record contribution income and assets or expenses if one of the following two criteria is met:

1.	The contributed service creates or enhances a non-financial asset (such as a building or equipment), or

2.	The contributed service possesses all three of the following characteristics:

  a.	It is the type of service that would typically need to be purchased by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School if it had not been contributed,
  b.	It requires specialized skills (i.e. formal training in a trade or profession), and
  c.	It is provided by an individual possessing those specialized skills.

Contributed services that meet one of the two preceding criteria shall be recorded at the fair market value of the service rendered.

### Receipts and Disclosures

Chattahoochee Hills Charter School and its donors are subject to certain disclosure and reporting requirements imposed under the Internal Revenue Code and the underlying Regulations. To comply with those rules, Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall adhere to the following guidelines with respect to contributions received by the Organization.

For any separate contribution received by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School, it shall provide a receipt to the donor. The receipt shall be prepared by the Chattahoochee Hills Charter School Development department. All receipts prepared by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall include the following information:

1.	The amount of cash received and/or a description (but not an assessment of the value) of any non-cash property received;

2.	A statement of whether Chattahoochee Hills Charter School provided any goods or services to the donor in consideration, in whole or in part, for any of the cash or property received by the Organization from the donor, and

3.	If any goods or services were provided to the donor by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School, a description of those goods or services.

No estimates of the fair market value of goods or services provided by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall be prepared by the accounting department.
