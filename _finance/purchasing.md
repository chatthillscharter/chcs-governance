## Check Preparation

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to process vendor checks and expense reimbursement checks on a weekly basis. Checks shall be prepared by persons independent of those who initiate or approve expenditures, as well as those who are authorized check signers.

All vendor and expense reimbursement checks shall be produced in accordance with the following guidelines:

1.	Expenditures must be supported in conformity with the purchasing, accounts payable, and travel and business entertainment policies described in this manual
2.	Timing of disbursements should generally be made to take advantage of all early-payment discounts offered by vendors
3.	Generally, all vendors shall be paid within 30 days of submitting a proper invoice upon delivery of the requested goods or services
4.	Total cash requirements associated with each check run is monitored in conjunction with available cash balance in bank prior to the release of any checks
5.	All supporting documentation is attached to the corresponding check prior to forwarding the entire package to an authorized check signer
6.	Checks shall be utilized in numerical order (unused checks are stored in a locked safe in the
Accounting department)
7.	Checks shall never be made payable to "bearer'' or "cash"
8.	Checks shall never be signed prior to being prepared
9.	Upon the preparation of a check, vendor invoices and other supporting documentation shall immediately be canceled in order to prevent subsequent reuse.

## Check Signing

Checks of Less than $5,000 require a single signature. Checks of $5,000 or more require two signatures.

Check signers should examine all original supporting documentation to ensure that each item has been properly checked prior to signing a check. Checks should not be signed if supporting documentation appears to be missing or there are any questions about a disbursement.

## Mailing of Checks

After signature, checks are returned to the ASC who then mails the checks.

## Voided Checks and Stop Payments

Checks may be voided due to processing errors by making proper notations in the check register and defacing the check by clearly marking it as "VOID". All voided checks shall be retained to aid in preparation of bank reconciliations.

Stop payment orders may be made for checks lost in the mail or other valid reasons. Stop payments are processed by telephone instruction and written authorization to the bank by accounting personnel with this authority. A journal entry is made to record the stop payment and any related bank fees.

## Record-Keeping Associated with Independent Contractors

Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall obtain a completed Form W-9 or a W-9 substitute from all vendors to whom payments are made. A record shall be maintained of all vendors to whom a Form 1099 is required to be issued at year-end. Payments to such vendors shall be accumulated over the course of a calendar year.
