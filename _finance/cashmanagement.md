## Cash and Cash Management

### Cash Accounts

The primary operating account provides for routine business check disbursements.

Cash transfers are done on an as needed basis to cover disbursements. Excess funds in this account are transferred into short-term investments or higher interest-bearing cash equivalents when it is prudent to do so.

### Bank Reconciliations

Bank account statements are received each month and forwarded to the Administrative Services Coordinator. This individual shall open the statement and review its contents for unusual or unexplained items, such as unusual endorsements on checks, indications of alterations to checks, etc. Unusual or unexplained items shall be reported immediately to the Principal.

After this review is complete, reconciliation between the bank balance and general ledger balance is prepared by someone who is not an authorized check signer. All bank reconciliations, including any adjusting journal entries resulting from preparing bank reconciliations, are reviewed by the outside CPA on a monthly basis. Bank reconciliations and copies of resulting journal entries are filed in the current year's accounting files.

### Stale Checks

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to write off checks of $500 or less that are more than 6 months old that have not cleared the Organization's bank. For un-cashed checks that are more than 6 months old and that exceed $500, contact will be made with the payee to resolve the issue.

All stale checks that are written off within the same fiscal year as they were written shall be credited to the same expense or asset account that was debited when the check was written, or the expenditure incurred. For stale checks written off in fiscal years subsequent to the year in which the check was written, the credit shall be to miscellaneous income.

### Petty Cash

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to provide for incidental funds (used for payment of minor office expenditures) only for valid transactions and to periodically replenish these funds up to its authorized balance of $150. It is the responsibility of the Business Office Coordinator to ensure that the petty cash fund is locked at all times.

All disbursements from the petty cash fund must be accompanied by a completed and approved petty cash voucher. Receipts are required for all disbursements from petty cash.

The petty cash custodian shall prepare a reconciliation of the petty cash account on a periodic basis. Petty cash reconciliations are subject to review by the outside CPA.

##PREPAID EXPENSES

### Accounting Treatment

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to treat payments of expenses that have a time­ sensitive future benefit as prepaid expenses and to amortize these items over the corresponding time period. For purposes of this policy, payments of less than $500 shall be expensed as paid and not treated as prepaid expenses, regardless of the existence of a future benefit.

Prepaid expenses with future benefits that expire within one year from the date of the financial statements shall be classified as current assets. Prepaid expenses that benefit future periods beyond one year from the financial statement date shall be classified as non-current assets.

### Procedures

As part of the account coding process performed during the processing of accounts payable, all incoming vendor invoices shall be reviewed for the existence of time-sensitive future benefits. If future benefits are identified, the payment shall be coded to a prepaid expense account code.

The accounting department shall maintain a schedule of all prepaid expenses. The schedule shall indicate the amount and date paid, the period covered by the prepayment, the purpose of the prepayment, and the monthly amortization. This schedule shall be reconciled to the general ledger balance as part of the monthly closeout process.

## INVESTMENT POLICIES

### Introduction

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to treat all assets of the organization, including those funds that are legally unrestricted, as though they are held by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School in a fiduciary capacity for the purpose of accomplishing the organization's tax-exempt mission. As such, the policies described in this section are to be interpreted in light of that overall sense of stewardship, and the investment standards of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall be those of a prudent investor.

Donated investments shall be recorded as unrestricted, temporarily restricted, or permanently restricted income and net assets based on the existence or absence of such restrictions, as defined earlier.

## FIXED ASSET MANAGEMENT


### Capitalization Policy

Physical assets acquired with unit costs in excess of $1,000 are capitalized as fixed assets on the financial statements.  Items with unit costs below this threshold shall be expensed in the year purchased.

Capitalized fixed assets are accounted for at their historical cost and all such assets, except land and certain works of art and historical treasures, are subject to depreciation over their estimated useful lives, as described later.


### Contributed Assets

Assets with fair market values in excess of $1,000 that are contributed to Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall be capitalized as fixed assets on the financial statements. Contributed items with market values below this threshold shall be expensed in the year contributed.

Capitalized contributed assets are accounted for at their market value at the time of donation and all such assets, except land and certain works of art and historical treasures, are subject to depreciation over their estimated useful lives, as described later.


### Establishment and Maintenance of a Fixed Asset Listing

All capitalized fixed assets shall be recorded in a property log. This log shall include the following information with respect to each asset:

1.	Date of acquisition
2.	Cost
3.	Description
4.	Depreciation method
5.	Estimated useful life Depreciation and Useful

### Lives
All capitalized assets are maintained in the special fixed assets account group and are not to be included as an operating expense.  Fixed assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

In the year of acquisition, depreciation is recorded based on the number of months the asset is in service, counting the month of acquisition as a full month (Example: an asset purchased on the 15th day of the fifth month shall have 8 full months of depreciation (eight-twelfths of one year) recorded for that year.

Estimated useful lives of capitalized assets shall be determined by the Accounting Department in conjunction with the department or employee that shall utilize the asset. The following is a list of the estimated useful lives of each category of fixed asset for depreciation purposes:

| Asset Type | Life |
| --- | --- |
| Furniture and fixtures Up to 1O yr. General office equipment | 5 yr. |
| Computer hardware and peripherals Computer software | 3-5 yr. |
| Leased assets | 2-3 yr. |
| Leasehold Improvements | life of lease remaining lease term |

For accounting and interim financial reporting purposes, depreciation expense will be recorded on an annual basis.

### Repairs of Fixed Assets

Expenditures to repair capitalized assets shall be expensed as incurred if the repairs do not materially add to the value of the property or materially prolong the estimated useful life of the property.

Expenditures to repair capitalized assets shall be capitalized if the repairs increase the value of property, prolong its estimated useful life, or adapt it to a new or different use. Such capitalized repair costs shall be depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the property. If the repairs significantly extend the estimated useful life of the property, the original cost of the property shall also be depreciated over its new, extended useful life.

### Dispositions of Fixed Assets

In the event a non-expendable asset is sold, scrapped, donated or stolen, adjustments need to be made to the fixed asset listing. If money is received for the asset, then the difference between the money received and the "book value" (purchase price less depreciation) of the asset will be recorded as a loss if the money received is less than the book value and a gain if the money received is more than the book value.


### Write-Offs of Fixed Assets

The Operations Manager approves the disposal of all capitalized fixed assets that may be worn-out or obsolete. Property that is discovered to be missing or stolen will be reported immediately to the Operations Manager.  If not located, this property will be written off the books with the proper notation specifying the reason.
