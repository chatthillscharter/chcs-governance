## Monitoring and Reconciliations

On a monthly basis, a detailed accounts receivable report (showing aged, outstanding invoices by customer) is generated and reconciled to the general ledger by the accounting department. All differences are immediately investigated and resolved, and the reconciliation is reviewed by the Business Office Coordinator.

## Collections

Collections are performed on a monthly basis, according to a review of the outstanding items shown on the accounts receivable aging report. This report shows the current month's activity for each customer and prior months' balances outstanding for 30, 60, 90, and 120 days.

Customers with unpaid balances receive statements every thirty days. After a balance is unpaid for 60 days, an accounting department employee will contact the customer by telephone and attempt to collect the amount due. A record will be kept of all telephone contacts.

## Credits and Other Adjustments to Accounts  Receivable

From time to time, credits against accounts receivable from transactions other than payments and bad debts will occur. Examples of other credits include returned products and adjustments for billing errors. All credits shall be processed by an employee who is independent of the cash receipts function. In addition, all credits shall be authorized by the Operations Manager.
