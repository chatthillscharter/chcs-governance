## BUDGETING

### Overview

Budgeting is an integral part of managing any organization in that it is concerned with the translation of organizational goals and objectives into financial and human resource terms. A budget should be designed and prepared to direct the most efficient and prudent use of the organization's financial and human resources. A budget is a management commitment of a plan for present and future organizational activities that will ensure survival. It provides an opportunity to examine the composition and viability of the organization's programs and activities simultaneously in light of the available resources.


### Preparation and Adoption

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to prepare an annual budget on the accrual basis of accounting. The School usually starts preparing the budget in March. To prepare the
Organization budget, the Administrative Services Coordinator shall gather proposed budget information from the grade level coordinators and from the information technology person. The Administrative Services Coordinator then prepares the budget based on prior year actual expenditures and also based on the next year's grade levels.

The Administrative Services Coordinator, the Principal, the Operations Manager and the Finance Committee chair then review each line item of the budget to make sure that all facts and circumstances have been considered.

The budget is then submitted to the Finance Committee for approval.  Once approved by the Finance Committee, the budget is taken to the full board in October for approval.

### Monitoring Performance

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to monitor its financial performance by
comparing and analyzing actual results with budgeted results. This function shall be accomplished in conjunction with the monthly financial reporting process described earlier.

On a monthly basis, financial reports comparing actual year-to-date revenues and expenses with budgeted year-to-date amounts shall be produced by the accounting department.

### Budget Modifications

Budget modifications can be made with the approval of the Finance Committee.

## ANNUAL AUDIT

### Role of the Independent Auditor

It is the policy of Chattahoochee Hills Charter School to arrange for an annual audit of the Organization's financial statements to be conducted by an independent accounting firm. The independent accounting firm selected by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School will be required to communicate directly with the Organization's Finance Committee upon the completion of their audit. In addition, members of the Finance Committee are authorized to initiate communication directly with the independent accounting firm.

Audited financial statements, including the auditor's opinion thereon, will be submitted and presented to the Board of Directors by the independent accounting firm at the Organization's Annual Meeting, after the financial statements have been reviewed and approved by the Finance Committee.

### How Often to Review the Selection of the Auditor

Chattahoochee Hills Charter School shall review the selection of its independent auditor in the following circumstances:

1.	Anytime there is dissatisfaction with the service of the current firm
2.	When a fresh perspective and new ideas are desired

### Selecting an Auditor

The selection of an accounting firm to conduct the annual audit is a task that should be taken very seriously. The following factors shall be considered by Chattahoochee Hills Charter School in selecting an accounting firm:

1.	The firm's reputation in the nonprofit community
2.	The depth of the firm's understanding of and experience with not-for-profit organizations and federal reporting requirements under OMB Circular A-133
3.	The firm's demonstrated ability to provide the services requested in a timely manner
4.	The ability of firm personnel to communicate with Organization personnel in a professional and congenial manner
