## Personal Information and Access to Personnel Files

“Personal Information” is any information describing anything about a person who is an employee of the School or about actions done to or by, or about personal characteristics of such an employee, if such Personal Information can be retrieved from a system by a name or other identifying number or symbol assigned to such employee.
The School maintains personnel files on each employee.  These files may contain the following Personal Information:  application for employment; resume; copies of personal references; job evaluations; professional credentials or certification; copies of performance appraisals; disciplinary warning notices; letters of recommendation; criminal background reports and any notices, writings or reports related to the Employee.

To ensure that personnel files are accurate, relevant, timely and complete at all times, it is the responsibility of each Employee to promptly notify the School of any changes in name, telephone number, home address, marital status, change in legal name, addition or deletion of dependents, change in beneficiaries, change in Federal or State tax deductions, scholastic achievements, the individuals to notify in case of an emergency, or any other Personal Information.  Personal Information shall be updated annually by the Director of Operations or his/her designee.

Personnel files are the property of the School, and access to the information they contain is restricted.  This is subject only to applicable requirements of public records law.  Generally, if the School’s governing authority has a legitimate reason to review information in a file, then it is allowed to do so.  The Principal is directly responsible for the Personal Information systems and may adopt further procedural rules consistent with this policy.  No Personal Information may be accessed without first completing a written request to the Principal.  The Principal may grant blanket access to all or part of the Personal Information systems for employees whose jobs require such access.  All Employees granted access to any Personal Information in the files shall be informed of the substantive provisions of the policy and accompanying appendices.  In an effort to protect Personal Information in the system from unauthorized modification, destruction, use or disclosure, the Principal shall keep a log of authorized parties and specific access granted, and all Personal Information systems shall be password protected.

The School shall maintain and use only Personal Information that is necessary and relevant to the functions that the School is required to perform and shall eliminate Personal Information when it is no longer necessary and relevant to those functions.
If an Employee is asked to supply Personal Information to be maintained in the School’s personnel files, the School shall inform the Employee whether that information is legally required, or whether the Employee may refuse to provide the Personal Information.

The Principal shall establish disciplinary measures for the unauthorized use of information contained in the system, which shall include, but not be limited to the following:  reprimand; suspension or administrative leave with or without pay; termination;  referral to authorities for prosecution.
Employees who wish to review their own files should contact the Principal or his/her designee.  With reasonable advance notice, Employees may review their own personnel files by appointment.

## Access to Other Files

### Public Records

Public records are recorded accounts or information that are kept by the School for the conduct of School business and instruction.  Any person may inspect the public records of the School during regular business hours of the office in which such records are kept, provided adequate advance notice is given to the custodian of the records.  An Employee or representative will be present during the inspection of the records.  A person may purchase copies of the School's public records upon payment of a fee, which is equal to the exact cost of making the copies.  The School's public records may not be removed from the School except by an Employee who is authorized to do so.

### Scholar Records

Scholar records will be collected and maintained in the School office.  These records shall be available only to Scholars, their Parents, legal guardians or School officials who have a legitimate educational or instructional purpose for the records.  Both Parents shall have equal access to their child's records unless a court has ordered otherwise.  Upon receiving notification that a scholar has transferred and when the new school requests scholar records, the School will forward the records to the new School.  Copies may be made of a scholar's record if requested by a Parent or court appointed guardian.  The Principal or his/her designee shall maintain a log of persons who have accessed School records and the specific record(s) which were inspected or copied.  An Employee shall be present during the inspection of the records.

### Confidentiality of Records

If the School receives information as confidential from a public agency the School will maintain the confidentiality of such information unless directed to do otherwise by a court of law, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
