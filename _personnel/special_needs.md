Parents are responsible for notifying School officials if a scholar has any special medical needs.  School personnel will not address any needs requiring the services of a trained professional.  In most instances, the special medical needs will result in limited participation in certain activities and classes rather than any treatment being administered.  In all instances the Principal or his/her designee will make the final decision as to how the School will handle any special needs requests.
