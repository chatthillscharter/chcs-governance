### Eligibility.  
To qualify for FMLA leave, an employee must meet each of the following criteria and have a qualifying reason for the leave:
* Have been employed by the School at least twelve months.
* Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve month period or fifty-two (52) weeks immediately before the date the leave begins.

Even though the School may be a covered employer, employees must meet both of the above requirements to be eligible.

## General Policy.  
We provide eligible employees with 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for any of the following family and medical reasons according to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

* An employee’s own serious health condition, as defined, that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of the job.

* For incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care or childbirth.


* To care for an employee’s spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition.

* To care for an employee’s newborn child, newly adopted child, or newly placed foster child as long as the leave is taken in the year following the child’s birth or placement.

* To attend to a qualifying exigency relating to a spouse, child or parent on or called to active duty in the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation.  (Qualifying events may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.)

An eligible employee may take a total of twenty-six (26) weeks of unpaid leave during a single twelve (12) month period to care for the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a service member who is a current member or veteran (within five years) of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render him/her medically unfit to perform his/her duties.  The leave may be taken to care for the covered service member while he or she is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy or is in outpatient status or is on the temporary disability retired list.

If a husband and wife both work for the School, and each wishes to take FMLA leave for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of a healthy child, or to care for an employee’s parent (not parent “in law”) with a serious health condition, the husband and wife may be limited to a combined 12 weeks of leave.

### Requesting a Leave.
An employee must inform his/her supervisor/manager and Human Resources at least 30 days in advance of the need to take FMLA leave when the need for the leave is foreseeable.  If it is not possible to give 30 days’ notice, an employee must provide notice as soon as practicable and must comply with the School’s normal call-in procedures and attendance policy.  Failure to give appropriate notice of the need for leave may result in denial of the leave, disciplinary action and/or termination of employment.

To request a leave, the employee must notify his/her supervisor, complete the appropriate form(s) and return it to Human Resources by the required date.
The Principal and Director of Operations will inform the employee whether he/she is eligible for leave under the FMLA and, if so, will advise the employee of any information required and of the employee’s rights and responsibilities associated with the leave.  Human Resources will also inform the employee of the reason if the employee is not eligible for leave.

#### Additional Forms and the Leave Determination.  
An employee may be required to provide additional information to determine if the employee qualifies for FMLA protection.  Information requests may include documentation of the employee’s inability to perform his/her job, an employee’s family member’s disability status, continuing treatment and/or hospitalization needs or other circumstances surrounding the nature of the employee’s leave.  An employee must inform the School if any requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified.  An employee will be required to provide sufficient information informing the School of the timing and duration of his/her leave. An employee may also be required to provide certification and periodic recertification supporting his/her need for leave.  

### Certification of Health Care Provider.  
An employee’s treating health care provider must specify and certify the nature of the qualifying serious health condition, beginning/ending dates of incapacity, treatment, or care, etc. A Certification of Health Care Provider form must be fully completed, signed, and dated by the treating health care provider and submitted to Human Resources within 15 days of the date requested, absent extenuating circumstances.  If leave is requested to provide care for an eligible family member, both the employee and the family member’s treating health care provider will need to complete the applicable sections of a Certification form.  If an employee fails to provide the Certification of Health Care Provider form within 15 days of the date requested, leave may be delayed or denied.  It is an employee’s responsibility to ensure timely completion and return of the Certification of Health Care Provider form.

The health care provider may be asked to authenticate the certification or the School may ask for the employee’s authorization to contact the health care provider to obtain clarifying information related to the Certification of Health Care Provider form if questions arise at the time of approval reviews and any subsequent determination(s) related to leaves.  The School may also request certification and other updates as appropriate and necessary.

The School may also seek second or third opinions (at School expense) from independent third party medical experts. An employee (or the employee’s family member) may be required to submit to an examination by one or more of such experts.  An employee’s cooperation with such examinations is required and failure to cooperate may cause the leave to be delayed or denied.  An employee will be granted provisional leave while the School waits for clarifications and/or the results of a second or third opinion.

### Communicating Leave Status.
The Principal and Director of Operations will inform the employee if the leave has been approved, usually after receiving the Certification of Health Care Provider form. The employee will also receive a designation of his/her FMLA leave status in writing which will detail the type of leave being approved, along with the approved leave period, return-to-work date, and related requirements. The time off prior to approval will be counted as part of the leave if eligibility and qualification are established.  The School may retroactively designate time away from work that qualifies as job-protected FMLA and count the absences toward the 12-week entitlement.  An employee will be notified in writing of this designation while absent or after returning to work.  If an employee’s leave is determined to be non-qualifying, he/she will be advised in writing.

#### Serious Health Condition Defined.  

A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves one of the following:
* Overnight Care in a medical care facility.

* Continuing treatment by a health care provider that prevents the employee from performing the functions of his/her job (or prevents the employee’s family member from participating in daily activities, like work or school.)  

* The continuing treatment requirement generally is met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with:

* At least two visits to a health care provider; or
* A visit to a health care provider and a regimen of continuing treatment.

Note: Treatment does not include routine physical, eye, or dental examinations. A regimen of continuing treatment does not include the taking of over-the-counter medications such as aspirins, antihistamines, or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a treating health care provider.
* Due to pregnancy or prenatal care.

* Due to a chronic condition.

* Chronic Conditions Requiring Treatments. A chronic condition that is documented by a physician and requires all of the following:
o	Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider or by a nurse or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider;

* Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and

* May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (for example. asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).

* Permanent/Long-term Conditions Requiring Supervision.  A period of incapacity that is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or his/her family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.

* Multiple Treatments (Non-Chronic Conditions). Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery) by a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days.

### Personal Time Off.  

When an employee requests FMLA, he/she is required to use his/her PTO in accordance with the School’s normal PTO policy unless he/she is receiving short-term disability or Workers’ Compensation payments.  After PTO is exhausted, unpaid leave will be granted until the end of the FMLA leave.  Leave time compensated with PTO, short term disability and/or workers’ compensation runs concurrent with (counts against) the employee’s weeks of available FMLA leave.

### Period of Leaves of Absence.  
The School measures the 12 month FMLA leave period as a rolling 12 month period counted backward from the date an employee uses leave under this policy. Each time an employee takes FMLA leave, the School will compute the amount of leave taken under this policy and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, specific to each rolling 12 month period. The remaining balance is the maximum the employee is entitled to take at that time under FMLA.

### Second Qualifying Event While on Leave.
If an employee has a second qualifying leave while out on approved FMLA leave, he/she may request approval for a concurrent leave. The leave periods may partially or fully overlap. The employee will be required to complete the appropriate FMLA leave forms and provide a Certification of Health Care Provider form to establish qualification, the leave period and a return-to-work date, which may be different. If the leave is approved, the employee’s  return-to-work date is the latter of the two leave periods.

### Benefits While On Leave.  

The School will continue to pay its portion of the employee’s group health insurance benefit premiums during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if he/she were actively at work.  If the employee receives a paycheck during the period of leave, the employee will have his/her benefit premiums deducted as usual. If the employee does not receive a paycheck while on FMLA leave, he/she is responsible for paying the employee share of the benefit premiums while on FMLA leave. At the beginning of the leave, Human Resources will provide the employee with information on how and when to make premium payments. Premium payments must be made within 30 days of the due date to avoid cancellation.  The employee must continue paying his/her share of premiums or the benefit coverage may be canceled.  If an employee does not return to work after FMLA leave, he/she may be required to reimburse the School for any benefit premiums paid on his/her behalf.

Use of FMLA will not cause an employee to lose any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of the employee’s leave.

### Manner in Which FMLA Leave May be Taken.  

FMLA may be taken in a single block of consecutive weeks, or, when medically necessary, leave for some conditions (including qualified exigencies) may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule.  “Intermittent Leave” is leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single illness or injury, rather than for one continuous period of time.  “Reduced Leave” is a leave that reduces an employee’s usual number of working hours per workweek or per workday.  In all cases, the total leave time may not exceed a total of 12 weeks in a rolling 12-month period.  
An employee is required to schedule leave for planned appointments outside of work hours so as to not disrupt the School’s operations or to consult with his/her supervisor prior to the scheduling of treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which best suits the needs of both the employee and the School without unduly disrupting the School’s operations.  

Requests for intermittent leave are handled the same as any other FMLA leave (See, “Requesting a Leave”).  Once FMLA status has been established, further requests for intermittent leave require the employee to:
* Notify his/her supervisor/manager and Human Resources of the need to use intermittent leave as soon as possible.
* Follow the School’s absence and call off requirements.
* Provide appropriate documentation for each time he/she uses intermittent leave.

Employees are not eligible for intermittent leave or reduced work schedules to care for a newly born or placed child.

The School may temporarily transfer an employee taking intermittent or reduced leave for planned medical treatment to an available alternative position with no loss of pay or benefits in order to better accommodate the intermittent or reduced leave schedule.

## Return to Work.  
As soon as you know your return-to-work date, the employee must notify his/her supervisor and Human Resources.  If the return to work date changes, the employee must notify the School immediately – no later than two days after learning of the change.  
An employee may be required to provide a fitness for duty certificate from the health care provider indicating the employee’s capacity to return to work and to perform the work required. The employee must be able to perform the essential functions of his/her job upon return. Requests for different (light) duties because of work restrictions cannot generally be accommodated.
When an employee returns from FMLA leave, he/she will be reinstated to his/her former position or an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. Exceptions may apply if business circumstances have changed and for certain highly compensated positions under conditions defined within FMLA legislation.
If an employee fails to provide a required fitness for duty certificate from his/her treating physician, does not complete the School’s return-to-work requirements and/or fails to return to work in a timely manner, the employee may not be reinstated to his/her job and may have his/her employment terminated.
Restrictions While on Leave.  No employee may not engage in other employment (including self-employment) while on FMLA leave (or on a leave of absence of any kind.)  A leave must be used only for the purpose requested.  If an employee uses a leave of absence for any other purpose, including for travel/vacation, the employee will be treated as if he/she voluntary resigned from his/her position.
