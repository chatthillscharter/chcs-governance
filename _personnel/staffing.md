## General Policy

On a regular basis the Principal or his/her designee will review the staffing, training and organization needs of the School for the purpose of recommending changes, if needed, to the Board.  

## Staff Development

The teaching staff of the School is encouraged to continue their professional growth through a variety of activities.  Teachers and Teacher Aides will attend in service training that is conducted throughout the School year.  Absence requests must be submitted to the Principal or his/her designee for prior approval.

## Performance Evaluation of Staff

Every staff member, both certificated and non-certificated will receive two formal performance evaluations during the year which will incorporate all ongoing assessments (observations) made frequently throughout the year.  Such assessments will include, but not limited to, the scholar performance outcomes.  

The performance evaluation process is designed to provide the information employees need in order to maintain or improve their performance.  The results of the performance evaluation will be used to assess continued employment and the level of compensation for the following year.  All evaluation documents shall be dated and signed by the evaluator and the person being evaluated.

## Performance Coaching

Following an employee evaluation, if the Principal or his/her designee determines that the employee's performance does not meet the standards of the School the Principal or his/her designee may engage the employee in the Performance Coaching Process.  This process shall not interfere with the School's right to terminate an employee.  

1.	The Principal or his/her designee will meet with the employee to discuss the performance concern(s) and to identify ways to improve the employee's performance.  This discussion must be documented and include specific measurable performance objectives that the staff member must meet within a specified time.  The date and time of the next meeting will be established before the meeting is concluded.

2.	If the employee does not meet the objectives by the time of the second meeting or if improvement is not sustained, then at the discretion of the Principal or his/her designee, a second plan similar to the first may be devised or the Principal or his/her designee may elect to proceed to step 3 (below).  This meeting also must be documented.

3.	If the employee's performance still does not improve or is not sustained at a level satisfactory to the Principal or his/her designee, then appropriate action may be taken which could include termination.

## Reduction of Staff

The Board reserves the right to eliminate positions and reduce staff as deemed necessary.  The Principal or his/her designee shall make recommendations for staff reduction and report them to the Board.
