## Scholar Activities
The formation of all scholar activities (clubs, teams, groups etc.) must first be approved by the Principal or his/her designee.  The Principal or his/her designee will give consideration to all factors in determining the potential value to scholars before final approval is given.  Copies of all the necessary forms, rules and regulations pertaining to the establishment of a scholar activity are available from the Principal or his/her designee.

## Fund Raising Activities and Projects

All fund raising activities conducted at or on behalf of the School must be approved in advance of the proposed activity by the Principal or his/her designee.  Copies of the forms and rules and regulations are available from the Director of Operations.  There is a potential personal liability associated with maintaining proper and accurate records, safeguarding and depositing funds and assuming responsibility for conducting and overseeing a fund raising project.  Staff members are advised to carefully follow all rules, regulations and policies governing fund raising activities.
