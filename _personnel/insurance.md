## Insurance

### Health Insurance and Annuities
The Board provides health insurance for all full time employees.  Hourly employees are not generally provided paid health insurance.  The amount contributed by the Board is determined annually prior to the start of a new School year.  If not so re-determined, is currently *75% of the premium or $250.00*, whichever is greater.  Employee contributions shall be made through payroll deductions.  If an employee is given a leave of absence for a period of time the Board will not pay the employee's health insurance except as required for eligible parties under the FMLA (See Policy No. 385 above, if applicable).  

The employee may elect to pay the premiums for such time as they are on an approved leave.  An employee who resigns prior to the end of their contract year will have Board paid health insurance only through the end of the month in which their resignation is effective.  If a teacher or paraprofessional resigns at the end of their contract year the Board will continue to pay their health insurance premium through the month of August.  Other staff members who resign at the end of their contract will have their health insurance paid through the end of the month immediately following the end of the contract.

### Workers' Compensation Insurance

As required by law, all employees are covered by Workers' Compensation Insurance, which may provide benefits for injuries or illness that occur as a result of employment at The School.  Any injury, regardless of its apparent seriousness must be reported immediately to your supervisor.  Failure to immediately report an on the job injury will result in discipline up to and including discharge.

### Retirement

By law, many Staff may be covered by the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS).  Some contractors may not be eligible for such benefits.  Determinations will be made based on law, facts and circumstances, in conjunction with applicable professional advisors and governmental agencies.

### Unemployment Compensation

By law, most workers are insured for unemployment compensation, which provides income payment in certain conditions for a period of weeks if you lose your job under certain conditions.
