Professional and support Staff members, because of their proximity to Scholars, are frequently confronted with situations which, if handled incorrectly, could result in liability to the School and personal liability to the Staff member.  Compliance with the following guidelines will minimize that possibility.

1.	Each Staff member shall maintain a standard of care for supervision, control, and protection of Scholars commensurate with assigned duties and responsibilities.

2.	A Staff member should not voluntarily assume responsibility for duties s/he cannot reasonably perform.  Such assumption carries the same responsibilities as assigned duties.

3.	A Staff member shall provide proper instruction in the safety matters presented in assigned curriculum guides.

4.	Each Staff member shall immediately report to the Principal or his/her designee any accident or safety hazard s/he detects.

5.	A Staff member shall not send scholars on any personal errands.

6.	A Staff member shall not associate with Scholars at any time in a manner which gives the appearance of impropriety, including, but not limited to, the creation or participation in any situation or activity which could be considered abusive or sexually suggestive or involve illegal substances such as tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.

7.	This provision should not be construed as precluding a professional or Staff member from associating with Scholars in private for legitimate or proper reasons.

8.	If a Scholar comes to a Staff member to seek advice or to ask questions regarding a personal problem related to sexual behavior, substance abuse, mental or physical health, and/or family relationships, the Staff member may help the scholar make contact with certified or licensed individuals in the community or the facility who specialize in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of the Scholar's problem.  Under no circumstances should a Staff member attempt, unless properly licensed and authorized to do so, to counsel, assess, diagnose, or treat the Scholar's problem or behavior.

9.	A Staff member shall not transport Scholars in a private vehicle without the approval of the Principal or his/her designee.  Such approval shall be granted for emergencies only or pursuant to a Parental consent and waiver, and shall not operate to subject the School to liability for accidents or injuries.

10.	A Scholar shall not be required to perform work or services that may be detrimental to his/her health.

11.	Possession of weapons or any device designed to inflict bodily harm by any Staff member, Scholar or visitor while on School grounds, on a School vehicle, or at a School sponsored event is prohibited and shall result in suspension or dismissal of the Scholar or the employee.

## Scholar Abuse and Neglect

Any employee who knows or suspects child abuse or neglect shall immediately report the suspicions to the Principal or his/her designee.  The Principal or his/her designee shall then investigate and, if necessary, contact the appropriate authorities.  The identity of the Staff member shall be kept confidential to the fullest extent permitted by law.  The identity of the Scholar and any information pertaining to the situation shall be kept confidential.
