Some School employees may have an “employment-at-will” relationship.  This means that the employee is free to leave The School at any time, with or without reason, and that the School has the same right to end its employment relationship with that employee.  No one at The School has authority to make a contrary agreement with you except the Principal or his/her designee.  Any such contrary agreement must be in a formal written document and signed by the Principal.

## Employment Contracts

Employment contracts or letters are issued to some full time employees.  Supplemental contracts may be issued to employee's who perform duties in addition to their regularly contracted services.  Hourly rated employees are not issued annual contracts and they are considered to be casual employees and are paid on a time sheet basis.  All contracts are subject to final approval by the Board and may either be “At Will” contracts or otherwise as stated therein.
Salaries

The annual salary of each employee will be paid in 24 equal twice-monthly payments unless they begin their service after the start of a new year and in that instance the salary will be paid in equal installments through the end of the year.  Paydays shall be on the 15th and the last day of each month.  When payday falls on a weekend or a holiday, the payday will be the last regular workday before the weekend or holiday.

Certain convictions as outlined in Georgia Law will prohibit an individual from being employed in a public school.  A listing of the disqualifying offenses may be obtained from the School’s office.

In certain circumstances, an individual who would otherwise be disqualified may be hired if that individual’s offense has been rehabilitated.  Rehabilitation is limited to certain offenses; a complete list of offenses that cannot be rehabilitated may be obtained from the School’s office.  

To be rehabilitated, (1) the offense cannot involve a victim who was a minor or a victim who was or is a scholar; (2) at least five years have passed since the individual was fully discharged from imprisonment, probation, or parole or since the individual entered a guilty plea; (3) the individual has not pled guilty, been found guilty by a court, or been convicted of a rehabilitative offense two or more times in separate criminal actions; (4) the individual has provided written confirmation of rehabilitation efforts and the results of those efforts; and (5) as viewed by a reasonable person, the employment of the individual will not jeopardize the health, safety, or welfare of people served by the school.  The School has discretion to decide whether the offense has been rehabilitated. Teachers must possess physical and mental health so as to be able to fulfill the conditions of employment or the continuation of employment.

Teachers may be required to possess such other experience, training or special skills as may be required by the Board or the School administration for any specific position.

An educational assistant/paraprofessional must be under the supervision and direction of an assigned teacher at all times in the performance of their duties, although such duties need not necessarily be performed in the physical presence of the teacher except as otherwise stated in this policy.  An educational assistant/paraprofessional working for the School in a Title I supported program may be assigned to duties consistent with any of the following:
