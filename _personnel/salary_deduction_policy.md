It is our policy to comply with the “salary basis” requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  Therefore, we prohibit the School from making any improper deductions from the pay of exempt employees.  We want employees to be aware of this policy and that the School does not allow deductions that violate the FLSA.

Deductions from pay are permissible when an exempt employee:
* is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons other than sickness or disability;
* for absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for salary lost due to illness;
* to offset amounts employees receive as jury or witness fees, or for military pay;
* or for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith for workplace conduct rule infractions.  

Also, the School is not required to pay the full salary in the initial or terminal week of employment; for penalties imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance, or for weeks in which an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.  In these circumstances, either partial day or full day deductions may be made.

If you believe that an improper deduction has been made from your salary, you should immediately report this information to the Principal.  Reports of improper deductions will be promptly investigated.  If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, you will be promptly reimbursed for any improper deduction made.
