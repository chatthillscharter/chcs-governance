To ensure that the School’s electronic equipment is used only for lawful and appropriate purposes and to further its business interests, the School has adopted the following Policy which applies to all employees.  Each employee and scholar having access to the electronic equipment of the School is required to abide by this Policy.  The School will strictly enforce this Policy.

## Acceptable Uses of the School’s Equipment

Software and business equipment, including telephones, facsimile machines, computers, the School’s electronic mail system, the School’s Internet access, and copy machines (collectively, the “Equipment”) are intended to be used for business purposes only.  The Equipment is the exclusive property of the School, and its sole purpose is to facilitate the business of the School.  Each scholar and employee has the responsibility to maintain and enhance the public image of the School and to use the Equipment in a productive and appropriate manner.

## Unacceptable Uses of the School’s Equipment

The School’s Equipment may not be used for transmitting, receiving, or storage of any communications of a defamatory, discriminatory, or harassing nature, or materials that are sexually explicit, pornographic, or obscene.  Harassment of any kind is prohibited.  No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual’s race, sex, age, disability, religion, national origin, or physical attributes shall be transmitted through the School’s Equipment.  The School will not tolerate actions that may create a hostile environment.  Equipment may not be used for any purpose which is illegal or against the School’s policies or contrary to the School’s best interest.  Sensitive or confidential information respecting the School or its scholars or vendors should not be transmitted via the Internet or over facsimile machines without the consent of the School.  Solicitation of non-School business, or any use of the School’s Equipment for personal gain, is prohibited.

## Use of Cellular Telephones

###School Owned

The Board may provide cellular telephones to employees who by the nature of their job have a routine and continuing business need for the use of cellular telephones for official Board business.  Cellular telephones are provided as a tool to conduct School business and to enhance business efficiencies.  Cellular telephones are not a personal benefit and shall not be a primary mode of communication, unless they are the most cost-effective means to conduct School business.  Because cellular telephone accounts are billed on a time-used basis, Board-owned cellular telephones and services should not be used when a less costly alternative method of communication is safe, convenient and readily available.

The Principal is expected to see that:
1.	the need for each School-owned cellular telephone and cellular telephone service account is clearly justified for School business purposes;
2.	alternative solutions for work production and communication have been considered;
3.	employees provided with cellular telephone service accounts understand the purpose and limitations of usage;
4.	cellular telephone service account invoices outlining the details of usage are received and reviewed for conformance with this policy;
5.	employees reimburse the Board for non-business use;
6.	use of a cellular telephone service account is terminated when no longer justified by business requirements, the employee leaves the Board’s employment, and/or when the employee has by actions demonstrated a disregard for School policies.
School-owned cellular telephones may be used for the following:
  a.	    to place calls in emergency situations.
  b.	to place calls for the purpose of communicating with the administration, other staff members, or parents concerning classroom, School or School activities.

Cellular telephone service accounts are expected to be set at the minimum level that fulfills the business need for the position in question.  The cellular telephone contract that is selected for an employee should be the one that provides a combination of services including number of minutes, coverage, and local call zone most nearly matching the employee’s recurring business needs.  If the cellular telephone contract is based on minutes used, a minimal plan shall be utilized.  In other words, the smallest plan available to accommodate the particular business need shall be utilized.
Possessing a School-owned cellular telephone is a privilege and all employees are expected to use them appropriately and responsibly.  Staff members are responsible for managing the cost effectiveness of cellular telephone use by utilizing assigned landlines as available and appropriate.  Staff should know that calls outside the immediate area might result in roaming charges, in addition to long distance and regular charges, and that the Board is charged for both outgoing and incoming cellular telephone calls.

Safety is a priority of the Board, and responsible use of cellular telephones includes safe use.  Staff are not to use cell phones while driving.  Staff should plan calls to allow placement of calls either prior to traveling or while on rest breaks.
Cellular telephone calls are not secure.  Therefore, Staff should use discretion in relaying confidential information, particularly as it relates to scholars.
Staff must safeguard any Board-owned cellular telephone in their possession.  Reasonable precautions should be made to prevent equipment loss, damage, theft, and vandalism.  Upon resignation or termination of employment, or at any time upon request, the employee may be asked to produce the equipment for return or inspection.  Staff unable to present the equipment in good working condition within the time period requested (e.g., twenty-four (24) hours) may be expected to bear the cost of a replacement.  Staff who separate from employment with outstanding debts for equipment loss or unauthorized charges will be considered to have left employment on unsatisfactory terms and may be subject to legal action for recovery of the loss.

The Board reserves the right to audit all Board-owned cellular telephones and their use.

### Use of a Personal Cellular Telephone While at Work

Cellular telephone technology enables individuals to be reached whenever a situation arises necessitating immediate contact and communication, regardless of the person’s location at the time.  Therefore, the Principal as well as other Staff designated by the Principal may be reimbursed for additional charges for school use of their personal cell phone, if necessary.

Staff members covered by this policy shall provide the Principal with their cellular telephone numbers so that they may be contacted as the need arises.

Personal calls during work hours can interfere with Staff productivity and be distracting to others, regardless of whether on a cellular or regular telephone.  Staff is expected to use discretion in using personal cellular telephones while at work.  Staff is asked to make personal calls during breaks and lunch period and to see that friends and family members are aware of the Board’s policy.

Violation of this policy may constitute just cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination.

If deemed necessary, the Principal or Director of Operations shall prepare the necessary administrative guidelines for the implementation of this policy.

## Communications

Scholars and employees are responsible for the content of all information that they transmit over the School’s equipment.  All electronic communications must correctly identify the scholar or employee responsible for the communication.  Any information sent to an individual outside of the School via the School’s Equipment are statements that reflect on the School.  All communications sent by scholars and employees via the School’s Equipment must comply with this and other School policies.

## Software and Copyright Issues
To prevent computer viruses from being transmitted through the School’s Equipment, there will be no downloading or copying of any software onto the School’s Equipment without prior approval of the School.  No files of any kind will be downloaded from the Internet without prior approval of the School.  License agreements relating to any software, whether individually owned or owned by the School, will be strictly complied with.  Any scholar or employee desiring to reproduce or store information of any sort downloaded from the Internet should contact the Principal or his/her designee to determine whether the intended use is permissible.  Copyright laws are very complex and can apply even to information that appears to be freely available for any use.  No copyrighted material will be copied illegally on the School’s Equipment or transmitted through the School’s Equipment.

The Board encourages teachers and staff assigned to the School to make judicious use of appropriate printed materials, sound recordings, and electronic programs in the curriculum but recognizes that Federal law, applicable to public school districts, protects authors and composers from the unauthorized use of their copyrighted work.
The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials.  According to the copyright law, it is illegal to copy or reproduce on disk or paper, by use of school equipment or any other means, materials for which the person reproducing or the School does not own the copyright, unless the written permission of the copyright owner has been obtained, or unless the activity is within some of the limited exceptions to the copyright laws.  Copyright infringement carries with it serious civil and criminal penalties under law.
Title 17, Section 107, regarding the Fair Use of copyrighted work, reads in pertinent part:  

> . . . [T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or photo-records or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.  In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include B:
1.	the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2.	the nature of the copyrighted work;
3.	the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4.	the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
The Principal or his/her designee is responsible for disseminating the guidelines for duplication and use of copyrighted materials to all employees.  .

Any employee who is uncertain as to whether the reproducing or use of copyrighted materials complies with the procedures or is permissible under law shall contact the Principal or his/her designee.

U.S. Const. Art. I, Section 8; Copyright Act, 17 USC 101 et seq.

## Security

No scholar or employee may use a pass code or voice-mail access code that has not been issued to that employee by the School.  The School has the technical means, and the legal right, to monitor all office electronic mail and Internet communications sent to or from the School’s Equipment.  The School will exercise this right as deemed necessary by the School.  There are several legitimate business reasons for the School monitoring the use of its Equipment including:  (1) ensuring that the sole use of the Equipment is to further its business purposes; (2) preventing inappropriate and unprofessional comments, or even illegal activity, via its Equipment; (3) preventing and controlling the spread of viruses in its Equipment; (4) the need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace; and (5) controlling costs.

In some respects, communication via the Internet is not completely private.  For instance, certain information with regard to sender’s name, receiver’s name, and subject matter is tracked and recorded automatically at various stages of the transmission process.  In addition to these automatic tracking features of Internet communications, the School has the added capability, as well as the right, to monitor and record all information with regard to Internet communications into and out of the School, as well as all internal e-mail communications.  Despite certain equipment features that may give the appearance of creating privacy, such as passwords and the ability to delete and purge messages, scholars and employees have no expectation of privacy with regard to any communications or data transfer utilizing the School’s Equipment.  By using the School’s Equipment, scholars and employees consent to the monitoring of their activities on the School’s Equipment and forfeit any expectation of privacy.

## Violations

Any scholar or employee who abuses the privilege of using the School’s Equipment will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.  The School also reserves its right to advise appropriate authorities of any illegal use of the School’s Equipment.
