## Employee Discipline

The School is committed to establishing and maintaining supervisory practices and procedures that support effective operations in the interest of the organization and its employees.  Such procedures may include the administration of disciplinary action to assist employees in overcoming work related problems, performance deficiencies, or behavior that violates the School's policies, practices, and procedures.

Although the School maintains a progressive disciplinary procedure, circumstances may warrant disciplinary action outside of the progressive procedure.  For example, the progressive procedure may not be appropriate: (1) when the conduct at issue involves severe performance deficiencies, performance problems related to skill or ability, or certain types of inappropriate or disruptive conduct; (2) when the initial steps of progressive discipline do not assist the employee in correcting the problem; (3) when the employee occupies a position requiring the exercise of effective management and leadership; or (4) when the employee's actions, or inactions, may seriously impair the School's ability to carry out its mission.  If the School determines that these, or similar circumstances exist, the School may determine that the progressive disciplinary procedure is inappropriate.  Moreover, under certain circumstances, a supervisor may determine that although the procedure should be utilized, certain steps in the procedure should be omitted or repeated.

### Disciplinary Procedure

#### Step 1:	Oral Discussions and Warning

The initial step of the progressive disciplinary procedure is for the supervisor to discuss the problem with the employee as soon as possible after the incident or awareness of the problem occurs.  The supervisor should discuss the problem, suggest ways to improve or to correct the problem, and identify a time period for corrective action.

#### Step 2:	Written Warning

The second step is for the supervisor to provide the employee with a written warning.  The step is generally taken when the initial step does not correct the problem, although a supervisor may determine that a written warning is warranted as the initial step.  When a written warning is given an employee, the supervisor should meet with the employee, outline the problem, suggest ways to improve or correct the problem and identify a time period for corrective action.  The specifics of this discussion should be documented in a letter or memorandum that is provided to the employee and forwarded to the Principal or his/her designee of the School for placement in the employee personnel file.  A copy of the letter or memorandum should also be initialed by the employee.  If the employee refuses to sign it, this should be documented by the supervisor.

#### Step 3:	Suspension

Although not generally a step in the progressive disciplinary procedure, suspension may be appropriate as the third step.  If utilized at all, suspension is generally limited to two circumstances.  First, a supervisor may determine that suspension should be used as a corrective measure to emphasize the seriousness of a problem.  Second, suspension may be used because discharge appears warranted but the supervisor needs time for an investigation to be conducted to determine if discharge is actually warranted.  In any event, suspension is for a specified period and, except for exceptional circumstances, without pay.

#### Step 4:	Discharge

If prior measures fail to correct a problem, the final step in the progressive discipline procedure is termination.  If the supervisor is satisfied that discharge is appropriate, and the Principal or his/her designee concur, discharge should be initiated.  The circumstances that led to the decision to discharge the employee should be documented by the supervisor.

### Termination
In certain circumstances, The School will choose to be an “At Will” employer and as such an employee may be terminated without cause.  Whether an employee is “at will,” or, serving under a contract that requires cause for termination, listed below are some reasons which may result in an employee being terminated for cause.  This list is not intended to contain all possible reasons for termination.
