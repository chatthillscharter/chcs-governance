The School requires exemplary moral and ethical standards of conduct by its employees.  The Board also requires that all employees maintain high standards in interpersonal relationships with other employees, parents, visitors and with scholars.

A public school teacher may not (1) authorize or use his/her position as a teacher to secure authorization of a contract of the Board in which he/she or their family members or business associates have an interest (2) profit from a School contract he/she authorize unless it was awarded to the lowest and best bidder after a competitive bid, or, (3) have an interest in the profits or benefits of a School contract other than his/her own employment contract.

## Use of Alcohol and Drugs

Persons subject to the terms of this policy and the testing procedures are as follows:

1.	All employees.
2.	All employees of temporary employee agencies or employee leasing services assigned to perform work for or on behalf of the School or its subsidiaries.
3.	All employees of contractors providing services at School locations.
4.	All applicants for employment who may work at the School.

The policy of the School prohibits possession of, use of, or being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or other controlled substances during working hours, on School property at School programs, or School activities, in any facility maintained by the School, or in School-supplied vehicles.

Employees working at the School are a valuable resource and for that reason, their health and safety is of paramount concern.  The School will not tolerate any alcohol or drug use which imperils the health and well-being of employees or threatens its business.  The use of illegal drugs and abuse of other controlled substances, on or off duty, is inconsistent with the law-abiding behavior expected of all employees.  Employees who use illegal drugs or abuse other controlled substances, on or off duty, pose a risk to their own health and safety, as well as that of other employees.  Such employees also tend to be less productive, less reliable, and prone to greater absenteeism resulting in the potential for increased cost, delay, and risk in the School's business.  

Employees have the right to work in a drug-free environment.  In addition, alcohol and drug abuse inflicts a toll on the nation's productive resources and the health and well-being of American workers.  The School is, therefore, committed to maintaining a safe workplace, free from the influence of alcohol and drugs.

### Use of Over-the-Counter Medicine and Authorized Use of Prescription Medicine

Employees using over-the-counter medication or medication prescribed by a physician are expected to discuss potential side effects with a physician.  An employee using any drug which may alter his or her physical or mental ability must report this treatment to the Principal or his/her designee, who will determine whether the School should temporarily change the employee's job assignment during the period of treatment.

### Prohibitions

The School's policy prohibits the following:
1.	Use, possession, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, or sale of illegal drugs, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco products on School premises or School business, in School supplied vehicles, or during working hours.
2.	Unauthorized use or possession, or any manufacture, distribution, dispensation, or sale of a controlled substance on School premises or any facility maintained by the School, in School supplied vehicles, or during working hours.
3.	Use, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, storage, or any sale of alcohol or illegal drugs or controlled substances on School premises or School business, in School supplied vehicles, or during working hours.
4.	Being under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance or illegal drugs on School premises or School business or at any facility maintained by the School, in School supplied vehicles, or during working hours.
5.	Use of alcohol off School premises that adversely affects the individual's work performance, his own or others' safety at work, or which the School regards as adversely affecting its reputation in the community or with its customers.
6.	Possession, use, manufacture, distribution, dispensation, or sale of illegal drugs off School premises.
7.	Switching or adulterating any urine, blood, or other sample submitted for testing.
8.	Refusing consent to testing or to submit a urine, blood, or other sample for testing when requested by management.
9.	Refusing to submit to a search when requested by management in accordance with this policy.
10.	Failure to adhere to the requirements of any alcohol or drug treatment or counseling program in which the employee is enrolled.
11.	Arrest or conviction under any criminal drug law.
12.	Arrest or conviction under any law prohibiting driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
13.	Failure to notify the School of any arrest or conviction under any criminal drug law or laws prohibiting driving under the influence of alcohol or other drug, within five (5) days of the arrest or conviction.
14.	Refusing to sign a statement agreeing to abide by the School's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.
15.	Refusing consent or refusing to submit to pre-employment testing.

### Searches

1.	Whenever the School has reason to believe that an employee's work performance or on-the-job behavior may be affected by alcohol or drugs, the School may search the employee, the employee's locker, desk, or other School property under the control of the employee, as well as the employee's personal effects or automobile on School property or any facility maintained by the School.
2.	Whenever the School has reason to believe that an employee possesses alcohol or drugs on School premises, the School may search the employee, the employee's locker, desk, or other School property under the control of the employee, as well as the employee's personal effects or automobile on School property or any facility maintained by the School.

### Consequences for Violation of this Policy

1.	Violation of the School's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy may result in severe disciplinary action, including discharge, at the School's sole discretion.
2.	In addition to any disciplinary action, the School may, in its sole discretion, refer the employee to a treatment and counseling program for alcohol or drug abuse.  The Principal shall determine whether an employee it has referred for alcohol or drug treatment and counseling should be temporarily reassigned to another position.
3.	The School will promptly terminate any employee who tests positive for alcohol or drugs while undergoing treatment and counseling for alcohol or drug abuse, regardless of whether such treatment and counseling is voluntary or required by the School.
4.	The results of, or an employee’s refusal to submit to, any chemical/drug/alcohol test described herein may, in addition to any disciplinary action imposed, disqualify an employee from receiving compensation and benefits under Georgia’s workers’ compensation laws.

### Testing

1.	Whenever the School has reason to believe that an employee's work performance or on the job behavior may be affected in any way by alcohol or drugs, the School may require the employee to submit a urine, blood, or other sample for testing.
2.	The School will afford employees subject to testing the opportunity, prior to testing, to list all prescription and non-prescription drugs they have used in the last thirty (30) days and to explain the circumstances surrounding the use of such drugs.
3.	Employees subject to testing must sign an approved form consenting to the testing and consenting to the release of the test results to the School.  Refusal to sign the consent form will be considered refusal to be tested and will result in discharge and may result in denial of workers’ compensation benefits.
4.	The School, prior to taking any action, will give all applicants and employees who test positive the opportunity to explain in writing the test results.

#### Types of Testing

All employees are subject to the following types of testing:

#### 	Post-Accident Testing

Alcohol and drug testing is required of employees whose performance either contributed to an accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to an accident.  Because alcohol does not remain in the body for extended periods of time, testing will be done as soon as possible.

Reportable accidents that require testing include:

1. Death of any person.
2. Bodily harm to any person resulting in one or more of the following:
  a. Loss of consciousness
  b. Necessity to carry person from the scene
  c. Necessity for medical treatment (beyond first-aid)
  d. Disability which prevents the discharge of normal duties or pursuit of normal activities beyond the day of the accident
3. Explosion or fire.
4. Serious damage to the property of the School or others.
5. Any event that is serious in the judgment of the School requires testing.

If any employee who is subject to post-accident testing is conscious, and refuses to be tested, that person will immediately be placed on suspension, pending further disciplinary action.

#### Other Testing

Alcohol and drug testing of employees will be conducted when there is reason to believe the employee is impaired from the use of alcohol or drugs.  A decision to test will be based on specific physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of possible alcohol or drug use.  For example, repeated errors on the job, regulatory or School rule violations, or unusual time and attendance patterns, could provide evidence to test an employee based on reasonable cause.

Any employee who is tested will immediately be placed on suspension pending test results.

The School may conduct pre-employment testing.

### Medical Examinations

Employees may be required to undergo medical examinations from time to time during their employment if, in the judgment of the School, such examinations are shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.  A School-designated health care provider may perform examinations or the employee may be required to provide results of a medical examination from the employee's health care provider.  The School will maintain employee medical records in a file separate from other personnel records, and access to such medical information will be restricted as allowed or required by law.

## Genetic Information
In the course of your employment, there may be situations in which you are required to provide medical information to the Company (FMLA, leave of absence, workers’ compensation, etc.)  The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) restricts employers from requesting or requiring genetic information, except in limited circumstances.  Accordingly, employees should not provide any genetic information when responding to requests for medical information.

‘Genetic information’ includes an individual’s family medical history, the results of an individual’s or family member’s genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual’s family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual’s family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.

## Mandatory Reporting of Misconduct by Licensed Employees

The Board recognizes its responsibility to effectively address employee misconduct.

### Definitions

“Licensed professional staff member” refers to employees who hold an educator's license or certification with the Georgia Department of Education (“GaDOE”) (including Director of Operations), educational assistants (aides with a permit and paraprofessionals with a license from GaDOE), employee holding a one (1) year conditional teaching permit in the area of intervention specialist or seeking an alternative educator license, and those employees who do not hold a valid educator's license but who are employed by the Board under a Pupil Activity Program Permit.  For purposes of this policy, licensed professional staff member will be referred to as “employee.”

“Conduct unbecoming the teaching profession” is defined to mean:

A. 	crimes or misconduct involving minors;
B.	crimes or misconduct involving school children;
C.	crimes or misconduct involving academic fraud;
D.	crimes or misconduct involving the school community;
E.	making, or causing to be made, any false or misleading statement or concealing a material fact in obtaining the issuance or renewal of any educator licensing documents; F.	the violation of the terms and conditions of a consent agreement with the State Board of Education;
G.	a plea of guilty to or a finding of guilt or conviction upon any offense enumerated.


#### Reporting Professional Misconduct

The School’s Principal is responsible for reporting teacher misconduct to GaDOE.  If the Principal is the employee who must be reported, the Board president or chairperson must make the report. The School’s Principal must report misconduct by an employee of an operator who is working in the School.

### Reports

Reports must be filed about School and/or contractor employees working in the School under the following circumstances:

A.	When the Principal, Board president or chairperson knows that an employee has a  guilty plea or conviction, or has been found to be eligible for intervention in lieu of conviction, or for a pre-trial diversion program concerning a disqualifying or other criminal offense applicable to teachers;

B.	When the Principal or Board president or chairperson has initiated termination or nonrenewal proceedings against, has terminated, or has not renewed the contract of the employee because the Principal or Board president or chairperson has reasonably determined that the employee has committed an act that is unbecoming to the teaching profession or a disqualifying criminal offense or other criminal offense applicable to teachers.

C.	When the employee has resigned under threat of termination or nonrenewal for an act that is unbecoming to the teaching profession or a disqualifying or other criminal offense applicable to teachers.  

D.	When the employee has resigned because of or in the course of an investigation by the Board regarding whether the employee has committed an act that is unbecoming to the teaching profession or a disqualifying or other criminal offense applicable to teachers.  

The report must be made to GaDOE and must include the name and social security number of the employee in question together with a factual statement.  The making of a report does not itself create any legal presumption that the described misconduct or any related crime has in fact occurred.  

A report must be kept in the employee’s personnel file. The State Board of Education may proceed to conduct an investigation to determine whether further action is warranted.  If, after an investigation, GaDOE determines that the results of that investigation do not warrant initiating action, the Board must move such reports from the employee’s personnel file to a separate public file.
