The Board authorizes the incidental transportation by private vehicle of School scholars. Any such transportation must be approved in advance and in writing by the Principal or his/her designee.  The parent of the participating scholar will be given, upon request, the name of the driver, the owner of the vehicle, and the description of the vehicle.

No person shall be approved for the transportation of scholars in a private vehicle who is not an employee of this Board or its contracted Educational Management Company, if any; an approved volunteer; the parent of a scholar enrolled in the School; and the holder of a currently-valid license to operate a motor vehicle in the State of Georgia (“Approved Driver”).

No person shall be permitted to transport scholars if s/he does not possess and maintain automobile liability and personal injury insurance.

The responsibility of professional staff members for the discipline and control of scholars will extend to their transportation of scholars in a private vehicle. Drivers who are not professional staff members are requested to report scholar misconduct to the Principal.

### Guidelines for Transportation of a Scholar in a Private Vehicle 
These guidelines are to be followed whenever an Approved Driver will be transporting scholars by a private vehicle whether it is in his/her vehicle or another private vehicle:

1. 	Determine that transportation by School vehicle is unavailable or not feasible.

2.	Obtain written consent from each scholar's parent using Parental Consent for Transportation by Private Vehicle Permission Form. No scholar shall be allowed to ride in the vehicle without his/her parent's written consent.

3.	Submit Request for Transportation by Private Vehicle to the Principal for his/her approval prior to the trip. Attach the parent consent forms to the request form.

4.	The Approved Driver shall keep a copy of each scholar's Emergency Medical Authorization Form.

5. The Approved Driver shall provide the School office with a list of names of the scholars who will be riding in the vehicle.

This guideline does not apply if an Employee regularly uses his/her vehicle or another private vehicle to transport School scholars.  In such case, the School employee must comply with the Georgia Pupil Transportation Operation and Safety Rules.
