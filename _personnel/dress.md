Faculty and staff members are expected to dress in a professional and appropriate manner.  Proper grooming and attire have a positive impact on the teaching and learning environment.  The Principal or designee will be solely responsible for interpreting and enforcing the faculty/staff dress requirements. 

Employees will be neatly groomed and dressed with clean and neat hair.  Neatly dressed shall be defined as dress and grooming that is standard and conforms to local community and school district etiquette and decorum.  Grooming and dress that will disturb, interfere with, or detract from the educational process will not be allowed.  It is within these principles that CHCS will enforce the following dress code items, specifically but not limited to:
