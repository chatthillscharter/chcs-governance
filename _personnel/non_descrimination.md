The School is an Equal Opportunity Employer.  It is our policy to administer all of our employment practices, including those pertaining to recruitment, hiring, placement, transfer, promotion or compensation (i.e. wage rate), layoff or termination, and selection for training in a nondiscriminatory manner without regard to age, color, gender/sex, national origin, disability, race, religion, military or veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, or on any other basis prohibited by federal, state, or local law.  The School will also make reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals with known disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship.

Any employee with a question or concern about discrimination in the workplace is encouraged to bring their concern to the attention of the Principal or his or her designee.  No reprisal will be permitted for raising concerns or making a report.  Anyone determined to have engaged in discrimination or retaliation for a report of discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
