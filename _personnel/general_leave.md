[See Family Leave](family_leave.html)

## Return to Work.  

As soon as you know your return-to-work date, the employee must notify his/her supervisor and Human Resources.  If the return to work date changes, the employee must notify the School immediately – no later than two days after learning of the change.  
An employee may be required to provide a fitness for duty certificate from the health care provider indicating the employee’s capacity to return to work and to perform the work required. The employee must be able to perform the essential functions of his/her job upon return. Requests for different (light) duties because of work restrictions cannot generally be accommodated.

When an employee returns from FMLA leave, he/she will be reinstated to his/her former position or an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. Exceptions may apply if business circumstances have changed and for certain highly compensated positions under conditions defined within FMLA legislation.

If an employee fails to provide a required fitness for duty certificate from his/her treating physician, does not complete the School’s return-to-work requirements and/or fails to return to work in a timely manner, the employee may not be reinstated to his/her job and may have his/her employment terminated.

### Restrictions While on Leave.  

No employee may not engage in other employment (including self-employment) while on FMLA leave (or on a leave of absence of any kind.)  A leave must be used only for the purpose requested.  If an employee uses a leave of absence for any other purpose, including for travel/vacation, the employee will be treated as if he/she voluntary resigned from his/her position.

## Serious and Communicable Diseases Policy
It is the policy of the School that employees with infectious, long-term, life-threatening, or other serious diseases or illnesses may work as long as they are able to perform the duties of their job without undue risk to their own health or that of scholars other employees, or members of the public.

An employee who is diagnosed as having an infectious, long-term, life-threatening, or other serious disease or illness is encouraged to notify the Principal or his/her designee of the condition as soon as possible and should provide the Principal or his/her designee with any pertinent medical information needed to make decisions regarding job assignments, ability to continue working, or ability to return to work.

The School may require a doctor’s certification of an employee’s ability to perform job duties.  In addition, the School may request that an employee undergo a medical examination by a physician or other health care provider determined by the School.

An employee may be subject to an isolation requirement if he or she is infected with one of the diseases or conditions specified by the Georgia Health Department.  Employees diagnosed with one of the following diseases must immediately report the diagnosis to the Principal or his/her designee:  Amebiasis, Campylobacteriosis, Chickenpox, Cholera, Conjunctivitis, Cryptosporidiosis, Cyclosporiasis, Diarrhea (infectious or of unknown cause), Diphtheria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), Giardiasis, Hepatitis A, Measles, Meningitis (aseptic, and viral meningoencephalitis, but not including arthropod-borne disease),  Meningococcal disease, Mumps, Pediculosis, Pertussis (whooping cough),  Plague, Rubella, Salmonellosis, Scabies, Shigellosis, Smallpox, Streptococcal infection, Tuberculosis (TB), Typhoid fever, Typhus, Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), Yellow fever,  Yersiniosis.  This list is not exhaustive and may be modified in accordance with State and Federal law.

The School will attempt to maintain the confidentiality of the diagnosis and medical records of employees with serious diseases and illnesses, unless otherwise required by law.  Information relating to an employee’s serious disease or illness will be treated as confidential and ordinarily will not be disclosed to other employees.
The School will comply with applicable occupational safety regulations concerning employees exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials.  Universal precautions, work practice controls, and personal protective equipment will be used where appropriate to limit the spread of diseases in the workplace.  

Compliance with the Infectious Diseases Policy of this School is mandatory and failure to abide by the policy may subject the employee to discipline, up to and including discharge.

Employees concerned about being infected with a serious disease or illness by a pupil, coworker, or other person should convey this concern to the Principal or his/her designee.  Employees who refuse to work with or perform services for a person known or suspected to have a serious disease or illness, without first discussing their concern with the Principal or his/her designee will be subject to discipline.  In addition, where there is little or no evidence of risk of infection to the concerned employee as determined by the Principal or his/her designee, the employee’s continued refusal to work may be found unreasonable and could result in discipline, up to and including termination.

The School has discretion to subject an employee to an examination by a physician or other health provider determined by the School in order to protect the health of all pupils and school employees.  The School may place an employee on a communicable disease involuntary leave of absence when the employee has contracted a communicable disease that puts others in imminent danger of death or serious injury in the workplace or if an examination finds that he or she has contracted a communicable disease.
The School may require any employee who was put on a communicable disease involuntary leave of absence to obtain and present certification from a physician or other health care provider as determined by the School that the employee is able to resume work without risking the health of others.

These provisions do not limit an eligible employee’s ability to utilize accrued paid time off or unpaid leave time under the Family and Medical Leave Act, if applicable, during a communicable disease involuntary leave of absence.
