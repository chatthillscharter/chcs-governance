## General Safety Rules

The School has written and posted fire, tornado and emergency safety procedures.  These procedures are reviewed with Scholars and Staff members.

Scholars shall not be left unattended.  If a teacher leaves the classroom another Staff person must be left in charge.

In class projects, experiments and similar activities, which could have some measure of potential danger, must first be approved by the Principal or his/her designee.  If approved, the Staff member must provide intensive close supervision of the project.

Chemicals and chemical products shall be secured and placed in locked storage units.  (See School procedure manual for further specific actions to be taken regarding hazardous chemicals).

### Reporting Accidents

All accidents on School property, on School transportation and at School-Â¬sponsored events must be reported to the Principal or his/her designee immediately.  An accident report form must be completed as soon as possible following the accident and turned into the Principal or his/her designee.  These reports will be compiled, summarized and submitted to the Board quarterly.  

The main office and the class rooms have first aid kits for treating minor injuries.  Minor scratches and cuts may be attended to in the classroom or School office.  When a scholar is more seriously injured, the Principal or his/her designee shall contact the parent or guardian.  If medical treatment is indicated, appropriate steps shall be taken.  The child's health form should be taken from the file and be available for examination.  Teachers shall not administer medication to scholars.

Once EMS is called, they have the authority to determine if transport to a hospital is needed.  The School shall notify the parent or guardian regarding the accident and the action taken.
