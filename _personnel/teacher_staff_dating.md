The School prohibits relationships of a dating, intimate and/or sexual nature between teachers or staff and any scholar. Additionally, the School discourages consensual relationships between Teachers/Staff and the parents or guardians of scholars in classes or programming that the teacher or staff member directly facilitates.

The School also prohibits consensual relationships of a dating, intimate and/or sexual nature between teachers or staff with whom the faculty or staff member is in a direct/power relationship. Furthermore, the School strongly discourages these consensual relationships even when no power relationship exists.

In the event that a relationship of a dating, intimate and/or sexual nature between consenting staff members should commence, it is the duty of the staff members to report the relationship to the Principal. If the Principal is involved in the relationship, it is his or her obligation to report it to the Board of Directors or their appointed designee.

It is expected that any party involved in a workplace relationship to maintain the same level of respect and professionalism that is required of all employees. Should the relationship end, both involved parties should notify the Principal and Board appointed designee.

This policy is rooted in the recognition that Teacher/Staff relationships may be inherently unequal and contain an element of superiority or power. Consensual relationships between Teachers/Staff and Teachers/Staff-Parents/Guardians may give rise to the perception by others that there is favoritism or bias in educational decisions affecting scholars and/or other policies and procedures. These perceptions undermine the spirit of trust and mutual respect that is important to the School environment. This policy further strives to provide an environment that is free from sexual harassment.
