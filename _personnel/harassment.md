## Statement of Philosophy

The School strives for a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.  Each individual has the right to work in an atmosphere which promotes equal opportunities and prohibits discriminatory practices and harassment based upon age, color, disability, national origin, race, religion, or gender/sex, military or veteran status, genetic information, or sexual orientation.  Harassment, whether verbal, physical, or environmental, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

## Definition of Harassment
For purposes of this policy, harassment is defined as unwelcome or unwanted conduct of an offensive nature (whether verbal, visual, or physical) when:
1. submission to or rejection of this conduct by an individual is used or threatened to be used as a factor in decisions affecting hiring, evaluation, promotion, or other aspects of employment; or

2.  this conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's employment performance or creating an intimidating, abusive, hostile, or offensive work environment.

Examples of harassment include, but are not limited to: unwanted sexual advances; demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment or continued employment; repeated jokes which include offensive references to age, disability, national origin, race, religion, or gender; unwelcome flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic, verbal commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess, or sexual deficiencies; leering; whistling; touching; pinching; assault; coerced sexual acts; suggestive, insulting, threatening, or obscene comments or gestures; dissemination or display in the workplace of objects, written materials, or pictures which include offensive references to age, color, gender/sex, national origin, disability, race, religion, military or veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation; asking questions about sexual conduct; racial or ethnic slurs or epithets.
Harassment is unacceptable in the workplace itself and in other work-related settings, such as business trips, meetings, or business-related social events.

## Individuals Covered Under the Policy

This policy protects all employees.  The School will not tolerate, condone, or allow harassment, whether engaged in by fellow employees or other non-employees who conduct business with the School.  The School encourages reporting of all incidents of harassment, regardless of who the offender may be.

## Reporting a Complaint
The School encourages all individuals who believe they are being harassed to firmly and promptly notify the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome.  The School does, however, recognize that, in some instances, power and status disparities between the alleged harasser and the individual may make such a confrontation impossible.  In the event that such informal, direct communication between individuals is either ineffective or impossible, the following steps should be followed in reporting a harassment complaint.  A complaint may be filed by one experiencing or witnessing harassment.

1.	Notification of Appropriate Staff
Individuals who believe they have been subjected to harassment should report the incident to the Principal or his/her designee.  When appropriate, the Principal or his/her designee will immediately consult with the Board.  If the Principal or his/her designee is allegedly involved in the incident, then the individual should report the incident directly to the President of the Board.

The School encourages prompt reporting of complaints so that rapid response and appropriate action may be taken, but no limited time frame applies.  Late reporting of complaints will not in and of itself preclude the School from taking remedial action.

2.	Protection Against Retaliation
The School will not in any way retaliate or permit retaliation against any individual who makes a good faith report of harassment or who assists or cooperates in an investigation thereof.  Retaliation is a serious violation of this harassment policy and should be reported immediately.  Any person found to have violated this policy by retaliating against another individual for making a report of harassment or for assisting or cooperating in the investigation thereof will be subject to the same disciplinary action provided for harassment offenders.

3.	Investigating the Complaint

Any allegation of harassment brought to the attention of the School will be thoroughly and promptly investigated.  Confidentiality will be maintained where possible throughout the investigatory process to the extent practical and appropriate under the circumstances.  

4.	Resolving the Complaint

Upon completing the investigation of a harassment complaint, the School will communicate its findings and intended actions.

If the investigation finds that harassment occurred, the harasser will be subject to appropriate disciplinary procedures, as listed below.  

If the investigation determines that no harassment has occurred, this finding will be communicated as appropriate.

5.	Sanctions

Individuals found to have engaged in misconduct constituting harassment will be disciplined, up to and including discharge.  Appropriate actions will be determined by the School.  For example, action may include reprimanding the offender, documenting the occurrence in the personnel file, referral to counseling, withholding of a promotion, demotion, reassignment, temporary suspension without pay, or termination of employment.
Although the School's ability to discipline a non-employee harasser (e.g., customer, supplier) is limited by the degree of control, if any, that the School has over the alleged harasser, any individual who has been subjected to harassment by such an individual should still file a complaint and be assured that the School will take those actions it deems appropriate to end any harassment.
