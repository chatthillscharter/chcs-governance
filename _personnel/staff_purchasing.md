## Staff Reimbursements

### Travel
#### Authorization and Responsibility

Travel for staff must be authorized by the Principal.  Travelers should verify that planned travel is eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements.  The School may not have a credit card available for use.  All employees traveling are to use their personal credit card while traveling.  Upon completion of the trip the traveler must submit an expense report form and attach all original receipts to obtain reimbursement of expenses within two weeks.

The Principal’s expense report must be approved by the President of the Board.  The Principal and Director of Operations are required to review expenditures and withhold reimbursement if there is reason to believe that the expenditures are inappropriate or extravagant.

### Vacation in Conjunction with Business Travel

In cases where vacation time is added to a business trip, any cost variance in airfare, car rental, and/or lodging must be clearly identified.  The School will not prepay any personal expenses with the intention of being “repaid” at a later time, nor will any personal expenses be reimbursed.

### Travel Expenses/Processes

Airfare – Travelers are expected to obtain the lowest available airfare that reasonably meets business travel needs.  Travelers are encouraged to book flights at least 30 days and not less than 14 days in advance to avoid premium airfare pricing.  First class tickets are not reimbursable.  Coach class or economy tickets must be purchased for all flights.

Reimbursement for a commercial rental vehicle as a primary mode of transportation must be pre-approved and is authorized only if the rental vehicle is more economical than any other type of public transportation, or if the destination is not otherwise accessible.  Vehicle rental at a destination city is reimbursable.  Original receipts are required.
The School authorizes reimbursement for entry-level or the most economic vehicle available.  In certain circumstances larger vehicles may be rented, with supervisory approval.  The rental agreement must clearly show the date, the points of departure/arrival, as well as the total cost.  Drivers must adhere to the rental requirements and restrictions must be followed.  Original receipts are required.
When vehicle rentals are necessary, do not accept the additional insurance, the reimbursements will be denied.

Travelers will fill the gas tank before returning the vehicle to the rental agency to avoid service fees and more expensive fuel rates.
Parking fees, tolls, and other incidental costs associated with the vehicle usage are not covered by the rental agreement.

### Personally owned Automobile
In the interest of expense management, personal vehicle usage should only be considered when such usage will enable a documentable savings to the organization.  In cases where round trip travel exceeds 180 miles and is limited to one overnight stay, a rental vehicle should be used in lieu of submission of mileage reimbursement.  In cases of less than 180 miles roundtrip or 2 or greater overnight stays, a personal automobile may be used.

#### Reimbursement Criteria
A valid drivers’ license issued within the United States and personal automobile insurance are required for expenses to be reimbursed.

Reimbursement for usage of a person automobile is based on the IRS mileage rate.  This represents reimbursement for all vehicle related expenses including, but not limited to, gasoline, wear and tear, and person auto insurance.  A formal request for mileage reimbursement must be submitted within 2 weeks of the dates of travel.

#### Lodging (commercial)
The cost of overnight lodging (room rate only) must be pre-approved by the Principal.  Always book a government rate.

If the government rate is not available, The School will reimburse lodging expenses at reasonable, single occupancy or standard business room rates not to exceed $180/night.  When the hotel or motel is the conference or convention site, reimbursement will be limited to the conference rate.

To reduce liability of sexual harassment or other potential complaints, each employee will have their own room.

Meals (Per Diem) – Per diem allowance are reimbursable for in state overnight travel that is 45 miles or more from the traveler’s home or primary work site.
The School’s Per Diem rates are $64/per day as follows:

*	Breakfast 	- $12.00
*	Lunch 	- $12.00
*	Dinner 	- $40.00

Incidental expenses, unless specifically cited in this policy, will not be reimbursed.
Per Diem reimbursements are based on departure and return times over the entire 24-hour day and prorated accordingly.  Original itemized receipts are required.

If a free meal is included in a conference registration fee, built in to the standard, single hotel room rate or replaced by a legitimate business meal, the per diem allowance for that meal may not be claimed.

#### Conference Registration Fees

Approved conference registration fees are to be paid in advance by The School.  Business related banquets or meals that are considered part of the conference can be paid with the registration fees; however, such meals will be deducted from the traveler’s per diem allowance.  See Meals (per diem) for more detail.

#### Business Expenses
Business expenses including faxes, photocopies, Internet charges, data ports, and business telephone calls incurred while on travel status can be reimbursed.  Original itemized receipts are required.

#### Parking

Original receipts are required for parking fees (including airport parking).  The lodging bill can be used as a receipt when charges are included as part of the overnight stay.

#### Telephone Calls
The costs of personal telephone calls are the responsibility of the individual.

#### Tolls & Miscellaneous
Transportation Original receipts are required for all tolls, taxi, bus, subway, metro, ferry, and other modes of transportation.

* Airline club memberships
* Airline upgrades

* Child-care, babysitting, house-sitting, pet-sitting/kennel charges

* Other expenses not directly related to the business travel

## Staff Gifts
Scholars and their parents are discouraged from the routine presentation of gifts to School employees on occasions such as religious holidays.  Where a scholar feels a spontaneous desire to present a gift to a staff member, the gift should not be elaborate or unduly expensive.  The Board considers as always welcome, and in most circumstances more appropriate, the writing of letters to staff members, expressing gratitude or appreciation.

## Use and Return of Property

Each employee is responsible for the School’s electronic equipment or other property, supplies, and vehicles in his or her possession or otherwise assigned to the employee. It is the responsibility of employees to understand and care for all equipment used.  Report any defective, damaged, or missing equipment to your supervisor immediately. At no time should an employee operate or use damaged or defective equipment or attempt to repair any equipment without the supervisor’s approval.  Observe all established safety rules and use all required safety equipment or protective wear when operating the School’s equipment.  

At no time should the School’s equipment be used for personal use.  Employees will be responsible for incidents which result in damage to the School’s electronic equipment or other property, supplies, and vehicles, or to the electronic equipment or other property, supplies, and vehicles of another through the employee’s own negligence or misconduct, as determined by the School. Employees will be required to either re-pay the obligation or to sign a written authorization for deduction from pay for the cost of the obligation until the obligation is satisfied. 

Immediately upon request or upon termination of an employee’s relationship with the School, all property (including but not limited to texts, manuals, key(s), equipment, access cards, credit cards, security badges, name tag, cell phones, hand held computers, etc.) and documents and records (including all copies and electronic files) shall be left with or returned to the School.  The School will also take all action deemed appropriate to recover or protect its property.
