Georgia Law prohibits employers from taking any disciplinary or retaliatory action against an employee for making a report of a violation of any state or federal statute which an employee believes is:

1. a criminal offense that is likely to cause either an imminent risk of physical harm to persons or a hazard to public safety,
2. is a felony;
3. an improper solicitation for a contribution.

In order to receive the protection afforded, the employee must orally notify his or her supervisor of the violation and subsequently file a written report with the supervisor that provides sufficient detail to identify and describe the violation.

If the employee is unable to report the violation to his or her supervisor, the oral and written reports must be made to the Board.  Employees must make a reasonable and good faith effort to determine the accuracy of any information that is reported verbally or in writing.  

If the employer does not correct the violation or make a reasonable and good faith effort to correct the violation within twenty-four hours after the oral notification or the receipt of the report, whichever is earlier, the employee may file a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and describe the violation with the prosecuting authority of the county or municipal corporation where the violation occurred, with a peace officer, with the inspector general if the violation is within the inspector general's jurisdiction, or with any other appropriate public official or agency that has regulatory authority over the employer and the industry, trade, or business in which the employer is engaged.  

The employer will not retaliate or take part in any form of reprisal against the employee bringing the complaint.  Employees who believe they may have been subject to retaliation should report suspected retaliation to the Board President.  
An employee may be subject to discipline if it is determined that the report of wrongdoing was knowingly fabricated by the employee or was, knowingly distorted, exaggerated or minimized to either injure someone else or, to protect the reporting party or others.

Complaints of harassment will be handled in accordance with the anti-harassment policy.
