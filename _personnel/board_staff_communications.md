Staff members report directly to their immediate supervisor or the Principal, or his/her designee regarding administrative and instructional issues.  The Principal or his/her designee reports to the Board on all issues, which affect the operation of the School, and on any other concerns regarding the School.

All communications from School staff members to the Board should be submitted through the Principal or his/her designee.  This procedure shall not deny any employee the right to appeal to the Board through established procedures.  The appropriate forms to initiate a communication or an employee grievance may be obtained from the Principal or his/her designee.
