## Social Networking Websites

Staff Members who personally participate in social networking websites are prohibited from posting data, links, documents, photographs or inappropriate information on any website that are inappropriate, unprofessional and/or may result in a disruption of classroom activity. The principal of the School has full discretion in determining when a disruption of classroom activity has occurred.

Staff Members should not post, do, say or write anything on a social network that they would not want to see on the front page of the local newspaper or would not say or do in front of scholars, parents, or the governing authority.

Staff Members should monitor the content of their “pages” and remove anything inappropriate or questionable immediately.  Staff Members should not join and should end affiliations with sites that are unprofessional or inappropriate.

Staff Members should never post any information that would identify a scholar, and employees should refrain from posting critical comments about scholars and school officials.  The content and impact of some speech may subject Staff Members to discipline including termination.

Staff Members are prohibited from providing social networking website passwords to scholars.

Fraternization between Staff Members and Scholars via the Internet, personal e-mail accounts, social networking websites and other modes of virtual technology is also prohibited.

Access of social networking websites during school hours is prohibited.
Staff Members should educate themselves about and take all appropriate precautions available on the social networking sites they are using.  For example, “pages” should be marked private, and all requests to become “friends” should be approved by the Staff Member.  A Staff Member should never grant access to his or her “page” without knowing whom the person is making the request.

### Teacher Blogging

When used properly, blogging can be a great way for teachers to learn new ideas for the classroom.  However, Staff Members must use discretion and good judgment when posting comments on a blog.  

Staff Members who blog in their capacity as employees of the School, may be asked by the Principal to put a disclaimer on their blog stating that the opinions expressed are their own and they do not necessarily reflect the beliefs or ideologies of the School.

### Conduct Unbecoming to the Teaching Profession

Under certain circumstances the School’s Head Administrator must report acts unbecoming to the teacher profession to the Georgia Department of Education.  The definition of “conduct unbecoming to the teaching profession” includes but not be limited to the following:  “using technology to intentionally host or post improper or inappropriate material that could reasonably be accessed by the school community” and “using technology to promote inappropriate communications with scholars.”  
Accordingly, a licensed Staff Member’s use of technology may result in their conduct being reported to the Georgia Department of Education, which may result in GaDOE taking action on the Staff Member’s license.
