Any Trustee, officer, key employee, or committee member having an interest in a contract, other transaction or program presented to or discussed by the Board or Board Committee for authorization, approval, or ratification shall make a prompt, full and frank disclosure of his or her interest to the Board or committee prior to its acting on such contract or transaction. Such disclosure shall include all relevant and material facts known to such person about the contract or transaction which might reasonably be construed to be adverse to the corporation's interest.

The body to which such disclosure is made shall thereupon determine, by majority vote, whether the disclosure shows that a conflict of interest exists or can reasonably be construed to exist.

If a conflict is deemed to exist, such person shall not vote on, nor use his or her personal influence on, nor be present during in the discussion or deliberations with respect to, such contract or transaction (other than to present factual information or to respond to questions prior to the discussion). The minutes of the meeting shall reflect the disclosure made the vote thereon and, where applicable, the abstention from voting and participation. The Board may adopt conflict of interest policies requiring:

1. Regular annual statements from Trustees, officers, key employees to disclose existing and potential conflict in interest; and,

2. Corrective and disciplinary actions with respect to transgressions of such policies. For the purpose of this section, a person shall be deemed to have an "interest" in a contract or other transaction if he or she is the party (or one of the parties) contracting or dealing with the corporation, or is a director, trustee or officer of, or has a significant financial or influential interest in the entity contracting or dealing with the corporation.
