## 1. Election.
a. The Board shall establish and maintain a Board Development Committee. The Board Development Committee shall recruit candidates and present nominations for each open Trustee position. The Board Development Committee shall review each application or nomination, determine whether the individual is qualified to serve as a Trustee, and determine a pool of qualified candidates. Every candidate must be age 25 or older and meet all other conditions set forth in these Bylaws.

In recruiting candidates, the Board Development Committee shall search for leaders of the diverse communities that surround the School offering the areas of expertise necessary for the Board to provide high-quality policy guidance and fiduciary oversight for CHCS. Such areas of expertise may include but are not limited to law, finance, non-profit organizations, education administration and policy, and development. The Board Development Committee shall consider candidates who have served on the Advisory Board.

b. Voting: Each Trustee position shall be elected based upon the vote of each Qualified Household and each full-time employee of CHCS, and each Qualified Household shall receive one vote per available position. Each position will be elected by majority vote. However, if more than one position is available then the recipients with the greatest number of votes corresponding to the number of vacancies will be elected. A “Qualified Household” is any household that has no member employed full-time by the School and has a child attending the School.

c. Any mid-term vacancies resulting from the resignation, removal, or death of a Trustee shall be filled by the Board until the next full term election.

## 2. Term of Office
a. The term of office of all members of the initial Board is 2 years.

b. At the end of the first year, the Board shall provide for staggered terms of its members, by designating approximately one third of the Trustees to one-, two- and three-year terms.

Following the ￼expiration of those designated terms, the term of each Trustee shall continue for three years.

c. No Trustee may serve more than two (2) consecutive terms in office. Any Trustee wishing to serve more than two (2) terms will need to take one (1) year off before serving as a Trustee again. A Trustee may serve a 3rd term only if no one else is running for the position and it will be limited to a 1 year term.

d. The term of office of a Trustee elected to fill a vacancy in these Bylaws begins on the date of the Trustee's election, and continues:

(1) for the balance of the unexpired term in the case of a vacancy created because of the resignation, removal, or death of a Trustee, or

(2) for the term specified by the Board in the case of a vacancy resulting from the increase of the number of Trustees authorized.

e. A Trustee’s term of office shall not be shortened by any reduction in the number of Trustee resulting from amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws or other Board action.

f. A Trustee's term of office shall not be extended beyond that for which the Trustee was elected by amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws or other Board action.
