The purpose of the CHCS dress code is to create a safe and respectful community where students can place their sole focus on learning. The dress code is in effect from the start of the school day until the end of the school day. Students are required to wear the CHCS uniform Monday-Friday, unless otherwise noted.

Students must arrive at school in the CHCS uniform every day. The uniform includes:

1. The CHCS logo embroidered shirt [ordered from Lands' End](http://www.landsend.com/shop/school-uniforms/-/N-g54)
2. Khaki pant (pant, shorts, skorts, skirts, jumpers)
3. Rubber sole shoe (open toe shoes are not permitted)
