CHCS strives to create an ethical, responsible and productive School community atmosphere as stated in its mission statement. As a FCS, CHCS will follow the FCS Student Discipline and Code of Conduct approved by the Board of Education and titled Policy JD. The most current edition, Student Discipline/Code of Conduct: FCS Policy and Procedure “JD,” updated 6/19/2009 is found in Part D Section 5.

The Student Code of Conduct contains behaviors and the range of levels of consequences that will be applied for inappropriate behavior. The behaviors described are representative of the misconduct that most frequently cause disruption of the orderly education process. Of course, the list does not include all types of misconduct for which consequences will be imposed. A student that commits an act of misconduct which is not listed in the Code, but which is nonetheless adverse to good order and discipline in the School or which tends to impair the morale or good conduct of other students, will be subject to the consequences deemed necessary by the CHCS Principal.
