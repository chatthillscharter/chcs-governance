I. CHCS is charged with providing free education for all students. Neither tuition nor fees may be charged for state funded courses. All schools will provide free of charge basic materials which are required within each course of study. This includes texts and other reading materials in courses requiring use of such materials by students.

All textbooks, assistive technology devices and digital versions of textbooks that are acquired, library books, media materials, musical instruments, band uniforms or any other equipment or property purchased by CHCS with Quality Basic Education (QBE) funds or any other means of acquisition shall remain the property of CHCS. As a condition to receiving all or part of the state contributed QBE funds, the principal shall establish procedures necessary for the care and protection of these items.

It is the responsibility of the CHCS to establish categories for which students may be expected to provide their own materials, supplies and/or equipment. CHCS expects students to supply appropriate basic materials such as writing materials, pencils, crayons and pens. No specific brands of writing materials and/or pencils and pens may be required. “Appropriate” is defined as reasonably serviceable. A student, at his/her own option, may purchase additional materials for his/her use.

The School may charge reasonable fees for meals and extracurricular activities as long as the charges do not affect the academic standing of the student within the program, and are consistent with state law and policy of the Georgia Board of Education.

Fees or Fines May apply in the Following Categories:

A. Music: Instruments may be provided by the school. Instruments will be provided to students on an equitable basis until the supply is exhausted. Students may voluntarily participate using their own instruments. The school may not sponsor, endorse or participate in rental/purchase plans for students without receiving quotations from at least three commercial firms. All sheet music will be provided by the school.

B. Arts: At secondary levels, basic art supplies are provided by the school. Students may voluntarily participate in purchasing unique or quality materials to enhance their educational experience.

C. Physical Education: Students may reasonably be expected to provide an appropriate change of clothing for physical education; however, this does not constitute a uniform. The definition of “an appropriate change of clothing” shall be shorts and a top. Appropriate clothing for outdoor cold weather activities may be worn as needed.

E. Other legitimate charges include but are not limited to:

1. gate admissions;
2. student publications;
3. graduation fees for participation;
4. replacement or repair cost for loss or abuse of school property; and/or
5. Meals, for those students who do not qualify for Free and Reduced meal plans and do not come to school with a prepared meal.

II. The following sanctions may be taken against a student who fails to return or refuses to pay for lost or damaged school property, including but not limited to, musical instruments, sheet music, uniforms of all kinds, sports equipment, etc:

1. refusal to issue any additional school property until restitution is made; and/or

2. withholding of all grade cards, diplomas or certificates of progress until restitution is made.

III. Outstanding fees, fines or charges

A record of any outstanding fees, fines or charges will accompany students’ records whenever they move from school to school within the School System, and sanctions explained in sections I. and II. of this procedure may be taken against a student by his/her new school until the student settles matters with his/her former school.
