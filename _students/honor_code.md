The CHCS honor code requires that students respect themselves, respect others, and respect their environment. As part of fostering positive integrity in child development, respect will be reiterated and reinforced in the honor code.

## Students will Respect Themselves
CHCS believes that a clear understanding of oneâ€™s self contributes to responsible citizenship. Character development is an integral part of what is taught at CHCS. Our goal is to help students understand themselves and to recognize their strengths and weaknesses, thus creating greater appreciation of others. A committee of Faculty and Teachers will be assembled to decide appropriate consequences for integrity violations not underlined in the FCS Code of Conduct.

## Students will Respect Others

CHCS students will be taught appropriate, respectful behavior and therefore held accountable to this behavior. The disciplinary committee of Faculty and Teachers will decide appropriate consequences to disrespectful behavior towards others.

## Students will Respect their Environment
In order to promote respect for their learning environment, students will care for their community. Each day, students will clean their classrooms and School facilities. Caring for, cleaning, beautifying and respecting their environment is an important part of responsible conduct and behavior at CHCS.

Students will adhere to the FCS Technology Code of Conduct behaving in a responsible, ethical, and legal manner at all times when communicating virtually with the outside world.

Finally, as a public school, all students will be held to all standards in the FCS Code of Conduct.
